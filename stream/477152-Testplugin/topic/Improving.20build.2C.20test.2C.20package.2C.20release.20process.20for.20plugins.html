<p>Zulip just lost my laboriously typed message, so here goes again. I'll break it into smaller pieces this time...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="813668">@Sebastien Rosset</span> and I have recently done some work on the weather_routing plugin (and in Sebastiens case, other plugins too), and in the process we have come across parts of the build, test, package and deploy processes that seem like they could be simplified and streamlined. Rick suggested I start this thread to share ideas, hopefully come up with a common agreement on where we'd like to land, and ideally collaborate on doing what's required to get there.</p>

<p>Let me start by saying that I personally deeply approciate all the very hard work that has been done by several people, over a very long period of time, bringing OpenCPN to so many people on so many different platforms for so long.  That really is no mean feat.</p>

<p>I have considerable experience writing, building, testing, releasing, deploying and operating large, complex, mission-critical systems across multiple heterogenous platforms, so please rest assured that I do not underestimate the complexity of the task, or the effort that has gone into achieving it.</p>

<p>Lets perhaps start by trying to reach agreement on the high level goals here.  To that end I'll put forward a strawman proposal, which I welcome you to shoot down and/or replace:</p>

<li>OpenCPN remaining a wonderful, feature-rich, reliable, easy to use system.</li>
<li>OpenCPN developers loving the efficient development experience, and finding it easy to attract competent volunteers.</li>
<li>All of us spending our time on high-value tasks, rather than chasing repeated breakages of fragile stuff.</li>
