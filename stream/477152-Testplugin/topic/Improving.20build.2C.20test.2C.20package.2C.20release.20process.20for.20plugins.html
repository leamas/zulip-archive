<p>The first thing is actually the header. Currently, we have two ways of building plugins: testplugin and the shipdriver template. They differ considerably. </p>
<p>So first question: Are you referring to  the testplugin framework, more generally to all plugin builds or even more generally also to the core opencpn development processes?</p>

<p>I expect that Alec will answer too.  Testplugin is older and had about 25 plugins using it, all of Sean's plugins and a number of plugins that I helped to build and distribute. Shipdriver was done after the OpenCPN Plugin Manager was completed. Each one is has good aspects in my opinion also this is Open Source.</p>

<p>Thanks Rick.  Then I'll take a closer look at Shipdriver. The way that testplugin has been used in weather_routing_pi over time makes the build and test process difficult to understand and debug.  I understand it's also difficult to incorporate updates in testpluging into weather_routing_pi.  Perhaps Shipdriver solves some of those issues.  Either way, reading up about Shipdriver is good education for me :-)</p>

<p>Oh, to be clear, I've never tried this.  Sebastien just mentioned that it was non-trivial.<br>

<p>Quinton,  I am no expert here. I think that can be determined after you try Shipdriver and get more familiar with Testplugin. Shipdriver is more automated and TP is more granular using scripts or batch files which I find is more flexible.</p>

<p>Add it would be really nice to utilize Jon's local build system with circleci Desktop, to offload processing in the cloud to a dedicated computer where ever possible and to utilize local storage and cloudsmith, (why? because as opensource there are limitations by the cloud services)  but that is reaching pretty far.</p>

<p>I kind of doubt that we'll ever be able to hit a button and have all the plugins rebuilt and deployed with the plugin catalog automatically published.</p>

<p>I live in hope :-).   Nothing I've seen so far indicates to me that this should not be possible.  At the very least it seems like a worthwhile goal.  If we fail, we fail, but hopefully we will get some/all of the way there.</p>

<p>Please don't... The manual steps involved when publishing the catalog is not something we want to get rid of.  The best  we can do is to provide support to make the PR against the catalog. Handling the PR is manual; this is on purpose and not something we should change.</p>
<p>That said,  there is a a lot of opportunities to simplify the process up to the PR.. Another aspect is possibilities  to debug i. e. to create a tarball with debug symbols which can be imported and tested.</p>

<p>Oh, I totally get it.  We should not remove desirable manual checks.</p>
