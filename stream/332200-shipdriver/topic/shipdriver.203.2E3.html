<p>The script for Appveyor, unlike CircleCI, results in two builds for a commit with a tag, one for the code commit and another for the tag.  CircleCI has no workflow for the tag. Is it possible to adapt the Appeyor work to ignore the workflow for the tag?</p>

<p>Anything is possible. However,  it's seems to be more broken than so. The correct behaviour is to build the tag but not the commit . This applies to both appveyor and CCI.</p>
<p>I'll try to find some time later this week.</p>

<p>This would prevent the checksum error when both Appveyor builds have not completed and the fork of the plugins repo is used to make a PR.</p>

<p>Tag build is last so if this has not completed we get a checksum from the commit build metadata file, which will not match the tag build, if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>hm... do I understand you correctly  that it is the duplicated builds which is the problem? That is, does it matter for you if we build the tag or the commit as long as it's only one of them?</p>

<p>On MacOS Apple Silicon, I have been using sd3.3.1 for a while now - no problems.<br>
However, yesterday I re-ran <a href="http://circleci-build-macos.sh">circleci-build-macos.sh</a> and it did a lot of updating of homebrew and reinstallation of python etc.  Not sure why.  Anyhow, it is now building with wx315 instead of  wx32, which is no good.<br>
A check in the <a href="http://circleci-build-macos.sh">circleci-build-macos.sh</a> does indeed show it selects wx315.<br>
I have re-installed sd3.3.1 but still get the same result.<br>
Help please.</p>

<p>MacosWxwidgets.cmake does not exist these days.  Last seen on my system 18 Oct 2023.<br>
<code>circleci-build-macos.sh</code> was clearly building for wx315.</p>
<p>I have recently updated from MacOS 15.2 -&gt; 15.3.<br>
I launched Xcode explicitly and it downloaded and installed some components.<br>
I then re-installed sd3.3.1 and, hey presto, it builds with wx32 - so I am back in business.</p>
<p>Hunch: updating MacOS may have failed to update something in Xcode, leading it to fail to find something it needed and thence defaulted back to wx315.<br>
Lesson: Launch Xcode after a MacOS update, even though you do not need to open it explicitly otherwise.</p>

<p>4 hours ago I tried again with an untagged alpha build 'Try alpha build to see if MSVC works'.  It seems you can only see that one in appVeyor - at least in current build.  So the production build no longer listed.  This last one says 'build success' at the end but there were errors and nothing has appeared in my cloudsmith repo.</p>

<p>There has been an interesting discussion about plugin compatibiltiy at <a href="https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/discussions/4485">https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/discussions/4485</a>. The interesting part for us is how to manage the different API levels.</p>
<p>I'm thinking about  a new branch structure. Let's call them api-16, api-18 and api-19 (out ot the top of my head...). I'm thinking as I write, please bear with me.</p>
<ul>
<li>api-16 represents the  buster frozen builds.</li>
<li>api-18 represents the builds  we do today, supported from 5.10</li>
<li>api-19 represents the  bleeding edge supported from 5.12.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, as Dave said, for Shipdriver as such the api-19 branch is perhaps not that useful, we only need api-18. But shipdriver is also a template, and from that perspective we need to care about plugins  using api-19.</p>
<p>Next step would be to determine  a builds per branch matrix, something like:</p>
<p>*api-18:  windows, MacOS, android...<br>
*api-19: debian 13 , all incarnations. Notably tracks the new api-19 branch in opencpn-libs.<br>
*api-16; The frozen windows and buster builds.</p>
<p>When we build the api-18 branch we basically build everything we  build today, with the exception that the frozen builds are not updated which makes for a simpler PR workflow.</p>
<p>When we build the api-19 branch this is the development branch where we can test things, notably Trixie.</p>
<p>api-16 is basically never built, but could theoretically be patched  to solve something and rebuilt.</p>
<p>Practically, after the 5.12 release we wouild work on the api-19 branch,  buit cherrypicking more or less everything to api-18. </p>
<p>Vague ideas so far.  Thoughts?</p>
