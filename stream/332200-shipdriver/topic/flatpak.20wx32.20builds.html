<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="399559">@Mike Rossiter</span>  ... is still a WIP, but no time to fix now. We'll see, sorry.</p>

<p>Some few days ago I made a temporary branch in SD - wx32. This allowed for a tag sd3.2.0-beta1 to help me build SD for O5.7.1 in Windows.<br>
To use your latest work is it time to delete this branch and repeat the exercise with the latest PR?</p>

<p>Whatever you do with the branches, the tag is still there, it does not depend or belong to any branch. Nothing bad in that, but so you know.</p>
<p>Try to rebase and merge. Checkout your temporary branch, then do <code>git rebase master</code>. This time, if there are conflicts you should be able to sort them out, you have written at least one part of any conflict. But most likely, it will pass without conflicts.</p>
<p>After rebasing, do <code>git checkout master; git merge &lt;temporary branch&gt;</code> . This is  the way to handle a "feature branch" which is exactly what you have here. After merging the branch, remove it on github  to keep it tidy.</p>
<p>BTW: Have I talked about using "Rebase and merge" when you merge PRs? It's an option on the dropdown in the big green button "Merge", far superior to a plain merge.</p>
<p>Off for  while.</p>
