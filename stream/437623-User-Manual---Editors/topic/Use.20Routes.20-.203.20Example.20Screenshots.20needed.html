<p>You've all done a wonderful job cleaning up those pesky items that have hung around for awhile. Is there anyone who can complete the last three screenshots that are needed in Use Routes  <a href="https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:manual_basic:route_manager:use_routes">https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:manual_basic:route_manager:use_routes</a>   <br>
I think that would make the Basic User Manual clear of all FIXME.  <br>
 By the way we have a <a href="https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:editor_manual:no_disp">new plugin called "nodisp"</a>   Which will show the comments inside to only "Manager-Editors" so let's start using it when FIXME are needed so the manual looks cleaner to users.</p>

<p>I just made some screenshots that I'll add to Use Routes for Example 1.<br>
NOTE: When I drug the endpoint of Route A onto the start of Route B, Route B was removed from the list of routes. The manual says: "Route B will be appended to A. B will remain as is." I assumed that I would still have both routes listed and that Route A would have the waypoints of the combined routes.<br>
QUESTION: Is this a bug in the code or should the manual text be changed?</p>

<p>Terry, I have reviewed the manual and what is supposed to happen. We should definitely be able to join routes. I think it is a bug. Can you report this in github issues asva bug?  Please. I am on cell right now.</p>

<p>What do you mean the secondary route is removed?   Are you talking about the beginning part of the route being removed?   ... because the second question is specific about adding the last part of the route.  <br>
If you select "no" it should leave the entire route being joined to and the dragged route point just shares one of the points of the route joined to.  Then what you can do is simply delete the points you no longer want to use.</p>
<p>I think it is working now.</p>

<p>The second sentence is  "First part of route merged into this route?"  OR  "Last part of route merged into this route?<br>
depending on how the program makes its assumptions.  At least it is clear and gives you a choice. Seems like the best way to do it.</p>

<p>Yes, I guess it does delete Route B, but it modifies Route A  by combining a waypoint and moving some of the waypoints over to Route A</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="399865">@Rick Gleason</span> I used the term "secondary route" to refer to Route B in the first case (Route A waypoint dragged onto Route B). I didn't use that terminology in the Use Routes page. What's in Use Routes is what I've observed. </p>
<p>I didn't include screenshots for the case of dragging Route B's first waypoint over Route A's last waypoint. In this case Route A's waypoints are prepended into Route B and Route A is deleted.</p>
<p>The original text and that in the Merging and Combining Routes (<a href="https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/pull/2375#issuecomment-922271803">https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN/pull/2375#issuecomment-922271803</a>) implies to me that both routes should continue to exist.</p>
<p>There is also text above Example 1 that says "In the above the only route that is modified is the one that was dragged or appended. The other route remains as is." This is not what I see in the current build.</p>

<p>The image above is a still from a movie, no copy and paste. </p>
<p>This brings me to an idea: since route drawing and manipulation is largely dynamic, it may be easier or more instructive to have small snippets of movie instead of a series of still images.  May I get 5 times 10MByte space on the wiki?</p>

<p>Overlaying a pencil icon obscures the background when it's overlaid on the screenshot. I'll experiment with different screenshot mechanisms to see if I can get something that works.</p>
<p>I don't follow the procedure for Example 3. I don't get a circular route when I append waypoints and don't get an "append" popup. I can create a circular route by repeatedly going around the list of waypoints, but that's not what is described.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="720693">@Manfred Radmacher</span> Thanks for the screenshots. I'm going to be under way most of today (finishing a cruise) so it would be great for you to add them to the doc. If you can't get to it today then I'll do it tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="720693">@Manfred Radmacher</span>  The text says to start by appending waypoints and that an "append" question is asked when, but no "append" question is asked and the waypoints in the circular route are not added in one operation.<br>
Instead, I think that the text should be changed to direct the user to start a new route whose first waypoint should be the last waypoint of the circular route. This process better matches what's described (other than how to start).<br>
Do you see the same thing or am I mis-reading the text?</p>

<p>I was playing around some more to learn what O can do.</p>
<p>These are two ways to generate a circular loop. One by creating a new route and just place the n-th point on the first one. Then, no questions are asked.<br>
Or use an existing route, append a waypoint, drop it on the first on, then the question is asked. <br>
Not consistent, but that's the way it is.</p>
<p>Another fun fact: you can even create roots with loops:<br>

I am leaning towards suggesting that circular routes routes with loops should get a heading by itself and not be hiding in an example. Having a heading by itself, would help the reader to more quickly see what's interesting at the top of the page</p>
<p>BTW: the links at the top of the page are not working any more.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="720693">@Manfred Radmacher</span> I'm ok with making circular routes its own heading since it's a more advanced topic. I'll take another look at the circular route thing tomorrow.</p>

<p>I've updated the text on circular routes to describe the process that is the most reliable and matches Manfred's screenshots. <br>
It is possible to use New Route... but I had problems with its reliability. It seemed to need careful alignment of the 'pencil' on an existing waypoint before it would append the remaining waypoints to create multiple loops around a course.</p>
