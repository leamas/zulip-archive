<p>I noticed that we were so focused on the basic manual itself, that we did not update the FAQ, which could really have a good cleanup as things have changed elsewhere. Some of the links may be bad and the manual may answer some of the issues brought up, so perhaps some now links to the manual are needed. If editors have some time to contribute that would be a worthwhile area to focus.  I notice that this manual is getting better and better. Thanks.</p>

<p>BTW the FAQ "Search" and "Support and Report" are an important part of the Basic Manual and have been edited recently (but any improvements are welcome).</p>
