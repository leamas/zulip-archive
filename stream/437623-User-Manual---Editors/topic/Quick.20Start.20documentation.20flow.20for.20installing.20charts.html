<p>The current documentation flow goes from Chart Installation to Chart Install Fabio. The Chart Installation page can be daunting to new users and I found Fabio's page to be more useful for getting started. I think the Quick Start objective should be to get OpenCPN installed and working for some area of the world.</p>
<p>The Chart Installation page is nice background after knowing that OpenCPN is working. I'm thinking that we need a Chart Installation page (or maybe two): one for free ENC charts and another for O-Charts. Then the existing "Chart Installation" page could be merged with Basic Manual &gt; Set Options &gt; Charts, which seems to cover a lot of the same information.</p>
<p>Rick: Do you know if Fabio is still involved?</p>
<p>Comments?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="720743">@Terry Slattery</span>   I think Fabio is sailing right now. We haven't heard from him for awhile.  His page is not complete and needs work. I you would like to complete it, please do so. I am not yet sure what we will do with the current page which is still valid and provides an excellent overview of the options, but I will be thinking about this.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="720743">@Terry Slattery</span>   I think Fabio is sailing right now. We haven't heard from him for awhile.  His page is not complete and needs work and refinement:</p>
<ol>
<li>Text needs improvement.</li>
<li>Screenshots need improvement. Some of them are broken up and not complete. Others occupy too much real estate and have not been adjusted to be smaller before taking the screenshot. (Watching the appearance of slide bars when possible).</li>
<li>The table needs updating from the current page.</li>
<li>This page should be completed as though it will be a part of the Quick Start Chart documentation.</li>
<li>I will figure out how to include it.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to complete it, please do so. I am not yet sure what we will do with the current page which is still valid and provides an excellent overview of the options, but I will be thinking about this.  Thanks.</p>

<p>I am working on these page now to improve the installation and I've placed a HOLD on all the Quick Start Chart Install pages.<br>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="399865">@Rick Gleason</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="720743">@Terry Slattery</span> , wish I had been sailing, reality is I've been a little swamped with work travel. </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="720743">@Terry Slattery</span> the idea I had for the page was exactly what you wrote: help the user get OpenCPN installed and working for some area of the world - <strong>Quick</strong> Start, after all.  Please feel free to take over the lead for that page.  My next intended steps were to get the plugins for O-Charts and S63, understand how they work and propose a text flow for them, similar in logic to the one I proposed for Chart Downloader.</p>

<p>One comment on the "Table of starter Chart Sources": I see <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="399865">@Rick Gleason</span>  you've added four rows with all the possibilities for USA.  A few other countries have two rows, one for ENC and one for OSM Raster.  You've given options.</p>
<p>Although I see the value of letting new users know there are options and giving them the choice, I see more value in a <strong>Quick</strong> Start manual of <strong>only</strong> giving one option that gets a <strong>new</strong> user started and further down putting a link to the complete list of options.  Or having the complete table further down the page.</p>
<p>For USA I would leave only "USA - NOAA &amp; Inland charts" and "ENC".  For the other countries I'd leave ENC only.</p>
<p>Another way of doing this without removing rows from the table would be to add a "Suggested for New Users" column, and marking only one of the rows, in my example "USA - NOAA &amp; Inland charts"/"ENC" for USA.</p>
<p>My reasoning is that a <strong>new</strong> user might not know much about chart types, and might feel confused <span aria-label="confused" class="emoji emoji-1f615" role="img" title="confused">:confused:</span> .  I certainly did when I started with OpenCPN, I remember thinking "what the hell are all these ENC, RNC, etc?" <span aria-label="face with spiral eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f635-200d-1f4ab" role="img" title="face with spiral eyes">:face_with_spiral_eyes:</span>  I had to Google before going back to the manual and continuing my chart install. </p>
<p>Thoughts folks?</p>

<p>This afternoon I worked Fabio's ideas into the existing pages: Chart Installation, Chart Downloader and <a href="http://O-charts.org">O-charts.org</a>,  and have augmented the installation and use of Chart Downloader.  I think this addresses the issue.  There is still some more work do do in <a href="http://o-charts.org">o-charts.org</a>.</p>

<p>Just looked at them, I think this version is great <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="399865">@Rick Gleason</span> .  It is clear and short, but with access to more detail.</p>
<p>(I fixed a small formatting bug at the first table)</p>
