<p>I am proposing to simplify "position" management in the weather routing plugin.  This would eliminate having a copy of the list positions in the plugin. Instead, the plugin would use the marks that have been configured in OpenCPN core directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/issues/221">https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/issues/221</a></p>
<p>I am seeking feedback on ideas, historical context and opinions before I do anything.<br>
Thank you. Sebastien</p>

<p>This is a great idea.  I've been confused by the multiple stores on many occasions, and removing the duplication has been on my todo list too.  I will take a look at the detail of your proposal.  Another aspect that comes to mind is the ability to directly use locations stored in the vector charts.  Right now, to route from Harbor A to Harbor B, one has to create redundant markers for Harbor A and Harbor B, even if those are very well-defined locations in the vector charts.  I'll add all my consolidated comments to issue 221.</p>

I had an idea we could try. from "improve" branch, Git checkout "test" <br>
The make a PR to "test" and see how it builds.<br>
Let's do that now ok. I think I can handle it using Quinton's fork.</p>
<p>Also we have WR 1.15.21.22 now with 13 builds and just 3 fails.<br>
Should I push that up to plugin beta catalog?</p>
<p>The deploy landed here in Cloudsmith (with a search just for the 1.15.21.22 + tarball<br>
<a href="https://cloudsmith.io/~opencpn/repos/weather-routing-beta/packages/?q=1.15.21.22+tarball">https://cloudsmith.io/~opencpn/repos/weather-routing-beta/packages/?q=1.15.21.22+tarball</a></p>
<p>You can download the right file for your OS and "Import Tarball"</p>
<p>By the way, I've created Browser bookmarks in a dropdown menu for all the urls I need for Opencpn, plugins, CI builds etc. It is all in one place. Then with PW management on it gets easier.</p>

<p>I may close this request to merge with my "improve" branch depending on what we find out.</p>
<p>You will find the built files (metadata and tarball) in cloudsmith weather-routing-alpha.  Search on 1.15.21.22 (space) tarball and download it and then from inside Opencpn  Options&gt;Pl &gt; Import Plugin Tarball.</p>
<p>You many need to set the catalog to expert  (Search on the FAQs in the Wiki for how to do that.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="399865">@Rick Gleason</span> </p>
<p>I think the following comment I made on Sebastien's code sums up a useful point.  I'll copy it here for further discussion:</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the right answer is here, but it seems like there are a few different ways we could approach naming in general here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use commonly understood terms, even if they are confusing and/or inconsistent. e.g. is SPEED_OVER_GROUND the speed of the boat, the speed of the wind, the speed of the water, or the speed of something else? Convention says that it's the speed of the boat of course, but it's clearly ambiguous.</li>
<li>Use a systematic and correct way of describing these things, for example (using most significant term &gt; least significant term, but this could be changed):<br>
  BOAT_SPEED_OVER_GROUND<br>
  WIND_SPEED_OVER_GROUND<br>
  WIND_DIRECTION_OVER_WATER<br>
  etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>The merged "test" branch build successfully built 13 OS.  That is the same as the "improve" branch.  </p>
<p>I am willing to merge Quinton's test commit into the "improve" branch.  What do you guys think?  Seriously?</p>
<p>Also I would really appreciate a little training and assistance on getting the tests running on Windows.  I tried this for celestial_nav and was not successful. I believe I have installed gtest, but perhaps that ought to be checked first.</p>

<p>I have some more cleanup of my PR to do. But I could do that in a separate PR. It makes no difference to me. </p>
<p>Have my changes, in their current state in the improve branch in my repo, built correctly on all oS’s? If so, I think you can safely merge it. If no, I wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Yes I have tried to align both the code and the user facing labels with the<br>
standard sailing terminology.<br>
It wasn't easy because some of the labels were quite obscure. For example<br>
when a label is "wind velocity" or even just "V", it takes quite a bit of<br>
work to really understand what it means.</p>
<p>My strategy is to incrementally improve as I discover how it works. I had<br>
to reverse engineer the algorithms. I did make a couple mistakes along the<br>
way, and then I fixed them.<br>
If you find problems, let me know.</p>
<p>There is one really big difference with the tactics plugin: the tactics<br>
plugin is all about measurements from real instruments. Whereas the WR is<br>
all about predicting values. And sometimes there is just no matching<br>
terminology.</p>

<p>Understood, perhaps we should be making a list of those differences  and develop the added Terminology?  And put it in the Plugin Manual... just the differences.</p>

<p>I don't have a Windows machine handy to test, but in theory, you should not need to install gtest, or do anything other than the instructions in the PR. If they don't work, let me know what errors you see, and I'll fix them.</p>

<p>Terminology</p>
<p>NOTE: All of these terms are defined and illustrated in Tactics_pi documentation found by going to here in the OpenCPN Wiki <a href="https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:manual_basic:set_options:plugin_manager">https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:manual_basic:set_options:plugin_manager</a></p>
<p>Finding Tactics Link under Sailing<br>
and going to <a href="https://opencpn-manuals.github.io/main/tactics/index.html">https://opencpn-manuals.github.io/main/tactics/index.html</a><br>
These terms and used extensively and explained. The terminlology page is here<br>
<a href="https://opencpn-manuals.github.io/main/tactics/index.html#_4_terminology">https://opencpn-manuals.github.io/main/tactics/index.html#_4_terminology</a></p>
<p>The last page has my favorite diagram which is quite visual.<br>

<p>Please keep all the terminology in conformance with the Tactics plugin!!!<br>
This is a requirement. If you want to change something of that nature, please discuss it first.. Thanks.  We had many discussions and reached final agreement re terminology, but if you see something wrong please advise me.</p>
<p>PS Certainly making changes to clarify and conform to standard Terminology is perfectly reasonable and much appreciated. The some of the terminology I heard above is a bit confusing and not really in conformance with the standards.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="399865">Rick Gleason</span> </p>
<p>I think the following comment I made on Sebastien's code sums up a useful point.  I'll copy it here for further discussion:</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the right answer is here, but it seems like there are a few different ways we could approach naming in general here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use commonly understood terms, even if they are confusing and/or inconsistent. e.g. is SPEED_OVER_GROUND the speed of the boat, the speed of the wind, the speed of the water, or the speed of something else? Convention says that it's the speed of the boat of course, but it's clearly ambiguous.</li>
<li>Use a systematic and correct way of describing these things, for example (using most significant term &gt; least significant term, but this could be changed):<br>
  BOAT_SPEED_OVER_GROUND<br>
  WIND_SPEED_OVER_GROUND<br>
  WIND_DIRECTION_OVER_WATER<br>
  etc.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure about that one. "SOG" has a very specific meaning in sailing and everybody uses that term. When people say SOG, it always means the speed of the boat over ground. There is no ambiguity that it could be wind.<br>
So when there is a standard term, we should use it and not qualify it, unless somehow there is a really good reason to do so.</p>
