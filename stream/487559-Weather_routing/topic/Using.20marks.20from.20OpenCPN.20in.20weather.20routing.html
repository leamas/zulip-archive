<p>I am proposing to simplify "position" management in the weather routing plugin.  This would eliminate having a copy of the list positions in the plugin. Instead, the plugin would use the marks that have been configured in OpenCPN core directly.</p>

<p>I am seeking feedback on ideas, historical context and opinions before I do anything.<br>
Thank you. Sebastien</p>

<p>This is a great idea.  I've been confused by the multiple stores on many occasions, and removing the duplication has been on my todo list too.  I will take a look at the detail of your proposal.  Another aspect that comes to mind is the ability to directly use locations stored in the vector charts.  Right now, to route from Harbor A to Harbor B, one has to create redundant markers for Harbor A and Harbor B, even if those are very well-defined locations in the vector charts.  I'll add all my consolidated comments to issue 221.</p>

I had an idea we could try. from "improve" branch, Git checkout "test" <br>
The make a PR to "test" and see how it builds.<br>
Let's do that now ok. I think I can handle it using Quinton's fork.</p>
<p>Also we have WR 1.15.21.22 now with 13 builds and just 3 fails.<br>
Should I push that up to plugin beta catalog?</p>
<p>The deploy landed here in Cloudsmith (with a search just for the 1.15.21.22 + tarball<br>
<a href="https://cloudsmith.io/~opencpn/repos/weather-routing-beta/packages/?q=1.15.21.22+tarball">https://cloudsmith.io/~opencpn/repos/weather-routing-beta/packages/?q=1.15.21.22+tarball</a></p>
<p>You can download the right file for your OS and "Import Tarball"</p>
<p>By the way, I've created Browser bookmarks in a dropdown menu for all the urls I need for Opencpn, plugins, CI builds etc. It is all in one place. Then with PW management on it gets easier.</p>

<p>I may close this request to merge with my "improve" branch depending on what we find out.</p>
<p>You will find the built files (metadata and tarball) in cloudsmith weather-routing-alpha.  Search on 1.15.21.22 (space) tarball and download it and then from inside Opencpn  Options&gt;Pl &gt; Import Plugin Tarball.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="399865">@Rick Gleason</span> </p>
<p>I think the following comment I made on Sebastien's code sums up a useful point.  I'll copy it here for further discussion:</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the right answer is here, but it seems like there are a few different ways we could approach naming in general here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use commonly understood terms, even if they are confusing and/or inconsistent. e.g. is SPEED_OVER_GROUND the speed of the boat, the speed of the wind, the speed of the water, or the speed of something else? Convention says that it's the speed of the boat of course, but it's clearly ambiguous.</li>
<li>Use a systematic and correct way of describing these things, for example (using most significant term &gt; least significant term, but this could be changed):<br>
  BOAT_SPEED_OVER_GROUND<br>
  WIND_SPEED_OVER_GROUND<br>
  WIND_DIRECTION_OVER_WATER<br>
  etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>The merged "test" branch build successfully built 13 OS.  That is the same as the "improve" branch.  </p>
<p>I am willing to merge Quinton's test commit into the "improve" branch.  What do you guys think?  Seriously?</p>

<p>Have my changes, in their current state in the improve branch in my repo, built correctly on all oS’s? If so, I think you can safely merge it. If no, I wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Yes I have tried to align both the code and the user facing labels with the<br>
standard sailing terminology.<br>
It wasn't easy because some of the labels were quite obscure. For example<br>
when a label is "wind velocity" or even just "V", it takes quite a bit of<br>
work to really understand what it means.</p>
<p>My strategy is to incrementally improve as I discover how it works. I had<br>
to reverse engineer the algorithms. I did make a couple mistakes along the<br>
way, and then I fixed them.<br>
If you find problems, let me know.</p>
<p>There is one really big difference with the tactics plugin: the tactics<br>
plugin is all about measurements from real instruments. Whereas the WR is<br>
all about predicting values. And sometimes there is just no matching<br>
terminology.</p>

<p>I think the following comment I made on Sebastien's code sums up a useful point.  I'll copy it here for further discussion:</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the right answer is here, but it seems like there are a few different ways we could approach naming in general here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use commonly understood terms, even if they are confusing and/or inconsistent. e.g. is SPEED_OVER_GROUND the speed of the boat, the speed of the wind, the speed of the water, or the speed of something else? Convention says that it's the speed of the boat of course, but it's clearly ambiguous.</li>
<li>Use a systematic and correct way of describing these things, for example (using most significant term &gt; least significant term, but this could be changed):<br>
  BOAT_SPEED_OVER_GROUND<br>
  WIND_SPEED_OVER_GROUND<br>
  WIND_DIRECTION_OVER_WATER<br>
  etc.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure about that one. "SOG" has a very specific meaning in sailing and everybody uses that term. When people say SOG, it always means the speed of the boat over ground. There is no ambiguity that it could be wind.<br>
So when there is a standard term, we should use it and not qualify it, unless somehow there is a really good reason to do so.</p>

<p>Similarly, we don't say "wind speed over ground". People use TWD, TWS, TWA, etc. <br>
BTW, I checked my B&amp;G and there are two modes of operations for TWS and TWS: one mode gives the TWD with the ground as a frame of reference, and the other mode gives the values with water as a frame of reference. So yes in that case there can be a bit of ambiguity when people use TWD and TWS.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>For the UI, I think you're absolutely right.  For variable names in the code, I think it's worth thinking about. Not only for a particular variable like SOG, but also more generally. If I'm writing code, and I need two variables, one to represent boat speed over ground, and another to represent wind speed over ground, what should the two variable names be?  If we follow <a href="https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/issues/2">#2</a> above it's obvious (BOAT_SPEED_OVER_GROUND and WIND_SPEED_OVER_GROUND).  If we follow # 1 above, it's less clear. SOG and TWS?  As we've determined, TWS is ambiguous, so it could mean WIND_SPEED_OVER_WATER or WIND_SPEED_OVER_GROUND.  So now we need to make up a non-ambiguous term for it. </p>
<p>I'm not wedded to either system, but I don't think that the answer is trivially that we should use <a href="https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/issues/1">#1</a>, because it's both internally inconsistent, and ambiguous, so then you need to augment it with other rules to solve those problems.</p>

<p>Yes, that's exactly my point. I think the reason you originally started renaming things is that some of the terms were ambiguous.  I agree, and I think it's a good idea to remove all ambiguity.</p>

<p>Yes, that's pretty much the terminology I am converging to. The refactor is not complete and some variables and labels still need to be updated, but at least we are going in the right direction. It will take several more PRs to achieve complete standardization.</p>

<p>Here is the cause of the bad time zone error.  That time zone -40643156 is clearly not right.  We might have to rewrite the git history.  I think I can figure out how to do that if you like?<br>
Strangely enough the error does not occur on Windows or Mac, only on the other OS's.  </p>

<p>Quinton, yes it's a bit buried, but once you learn the online interface its pretty intuitive, you just have to double check things. I am still learning after how many years?  First go to the "test2" branch.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/tree/test2">https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/tree/test2</a><br>
Up at the top menu it goes "Code"  "Issues" "Pull Requests"  "Discussions" etc.<br>
Pick Pull Requests.  You will see 3 PR that are "Open".<br>
Now click on "128 Closed" which is part way down from the top.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed</a><br>
Now you will see the one I made this morning.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/pull/255">Quinton wr/improve --&gt; rgleason/test2 Trial Merge</a><br>
which has been merged.  There is a red X, hoover over the top and left click to reveal the list of builds, you will find 3 successful builds. This is showing CircleCI success just before merging your commits.<br>
Now go back to after I merged your commits in the "test2" branch<br>
<a href="https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/tree/test2">https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/tree/test2</a><br>
See the green check, hover and left click to see the list of builds (16 + all build).</p>
<p>So you think it is ok to merge your commits into "improve" branch  now?  How about <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="813668">@Sebastien Rosset</span>  what do you think since your the guy who's current work is in there.</p>
<p>BTW, I still have not figured out how the Cloudsmith key works in all cases where commits are coming from outside. It seems pretty fussy, but I think that has to do with CircleCI processes too, which change and are somewhat of a black box.  So sometimes I just have to ignore those pesky not building Cloudsmith keys.</p>

<p>OK, thanks Rick.  Here's where the confusion lay. You say 3 successful builds, but perhaps more importantly there were 10 failed builds, which is what I've been referring to all along. After you merged the PR, seemingly all 13 of the builds succeeded in some post-merge checks. That's crazy. We need to be very clear to contributors (including me :-) ) that the pre-merge checks are expected to fail, and are meaningless. Otherwise I spent hours pouring though the logs trying to figure out what was wrong.  Note that it's not only the "CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY must be set in the build environment" error that's occurring pre-merge.  It's also others, like "error: object <a href="https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/commit/23c07cc5d2be7ce68349f4b3719b6fa6fe90e0bf">23c07cc5d2be7ce68349f4b3719b6fa6fe90e0bf</a>: badTimezone: invalid author/committer line - bad time zone" and something about out of date modules (I can't find an example right now). Is it the case that the pre-merge checks are simply unreliable and should be disabled?  Do they ever give a useful signal, before a PR is merged, that it will not break the builds on any architectures?</p>

<p>CircleCI was formed in 2011. I used it quite extensively in 2015 and it was very flaky then, to the extent that we stopped using it. It sounds like it's still flakey in 2025. Perhaps we should find a better solution?  Just a thought. Waiting for it to become stable seems like an unrealistic strategy?</p>

<p>No, I have not tried any of those builds yet. I only wrote tests, which are disabled by default, so should not be able to affect the tarballs. It's theoretically possible that one of the minor changes I made outside of /tests has broken something, but I doubt it.  I don't have a Windows machine to test on, but I can test on a MacOS machine. Bear in mind that before I made any changes, I tried to build a working weather_routing_pi tarball for macos, and it failed with exactly the error you mention.  You, me and Sebastien discussed this extensively.  I believe that both Sebastien and I implemented manual local changes as a workaround, but I'm not sure that the automated build processes ever (recently) produced a valid macos tarball for weather_routing_pi.  I have no idea whether the problems applied to Windows too. </p>
<p>Let me try out the macos tarball from:</p>
<p><a href="https://cloudsmith.io/~opencpn/repos/weather-routing-alpha/packages/?q=1.15.21.22+tarball">https://cloudsmith.io/~opencpn/repos/weather-routing-alpha/packages/?q=1.15.21.22+tarball</a></p>
<p>I imagine it's probably missing the package.xml file like it always was when built on on my macos machine (or Sebastien's).   I'll get back to you once I know.</p>

<p>I have confirmed that the error when importing the macos weather_routing_pi tarball file is the same as it was before I started developing the tests. I tried it with OpenCPN v5.11.0 but I assume that's irrelevant.  The tarball is missing the metadata.xml file, as it was locally for me.</p>
<p>Rick, which version of OpenCPN are you trying to import the plugin into?  And which version of the plugin API does it support?</p>

<p>Interesting.  The latter tarball imported successfully. I can't imagine how my changes could have affected the presence or absence of the metadata.xml file, as I made no changes related to that. Maybe it's some other failure that's causing the metadata file to be excluded from the tarball? Either that, or the two tarballs contain different commits other than mine.  I'll dig in a bit.</p>

There must be a bug in the macos scripts somewhere (possibly related to the problems that Sebastian and I were having building a tarball for macos locally that included metadata.xml - we ended up having to do it manually).</p>
<p>If you tell me what code is used to build the tarballs that end up on cloudsmith, I can try to debug that problem).</p>

<p>It seems like functions like <code>AddCanvasContextMenuItem</code> are in the actual core OpenCPN.  The API headers just declare 'EXTERN' implementations of them.  I assume the definitions are elsewhere.</p>

<p>Yes, I do. The compile step succeeds. It’s the linker step that fails, because the method definitions are not found. I’m missing the library containing those methods to link against, not a header file to compile against.</p>

<p>I'm catching up on this thread, as I am helping with other issues as well. I'm not sure which specific issues you have at linker time. I had lots of similar issues in the VDR plugin. </p>
<p>In the test, I wanted to link against mock implementation, not the complete OpenCPN library. That's the approach that most tests use AFAIK.</p>
<ol>
<li>The tests are smaller.</li>
<li>Using mock implementation means it's possible to test all kinds of scenarios that would otherwise be really hard to simulate with the normal library.</li>
<li>I don't think linking against the real library would work anyway, because it might invoke UI code, want to pop up a dialog, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I haven't read the whole thread, so it's also possible I'm completely off topic.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="813668">Sebastien Rosset</span> you are right. I will need some mocks. I was hoping to get a very basic test which instantiates a Boat to run first.  Then add the mocks etc, and refactor boat code accordingly. But maybe I should give up on that goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's fairly straightforward to implement mocks  if you look at other plugins and OpenCPN core. That's what I did in the VDR plugin.</p>
<p>In general when I learn something, I try to write documentation and raise a PR so others can benefit.</p>

<p>Quinton,  I have not had this problem in a very very long  time, in fact I hadn't remembered it, it has been such a long time.   Commit 23c07cc <a href="https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/commit/23c07cc5d2be7ce68349f4b3719b6fa6fe90e0bf">https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/commit/23c07cc5d2be7ce68349f4b3719b6fa6fe90e0bf</a>  is dated  Dec 31,1969  </p>
<p>In fact I made a <a href="https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/releases/tag/show">Tag  "Show"</a>  some assets dated Dec 26, 2019  to try to help fix it.  With " Fix year to June 19, 2017"</p>
<p>The problem has disappeared since then until now.  Why?  Do you have some settings in your github account that are not quite right?  </p>
<p>I suggest you look at that first.</p>

<p>Now I see that Sebastien's pushes to api118 are also failing!!!<br>
What has changed here, quite obviously some setting has changed and I don't believe that I changed it.   But I am going to go back and delete a key that I made which Jon asked me to make, but he advised it is the wrong key to use. I will delete that and see if it fixes the problem.</p>

<p>I have deleted the  github &gt; project &gt; settings &gt; developer settings &gt; personal access tokens &gt;  tokens classic  &gt;  I have remove the token.</p>
<p>I may need to add it again.  Also I will remove another token in CircleCI which I added in the wrong location.  Perhaps this is causing the problem.<br>
CircleCI  under top right icon &gt; User Settings rgleason   &gt; Personnal API Tokens &gt;  removed "Github_token"  (It is in the wrong place.) </p>
<p>Next I will update the TP Template to Jon's most current, and then follow his instructions, so that perhaps CS deployment of tarballs and metadata works better.</p>
<p>Also, I hope this issue will disappear.</p>

<p><code>git config --global fetch.fsck.badTimezone ignore</code><br>
Works for me when cloning submodules, this just disables it for fetch.</p>
<p>Possibly a better solution<br>

<p>To fix the commit from years ago would require  git rebase and then a forced push which will change history, and screw up everyone who has forked the repo.   We can't do this!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Option 3: Ignoring Dates in CI/CD</strong><br>
If your issue is related to automated systems (such as a CI/CD pipeline), check whether the system relies on commit timestamps. Some tools allow overriding timestamps using environment variables.</p>
