<p>I am proposing to simplify "position" management in the weather routing plugin.  This would eliminate having a copy of the list positions in the plugin. Instead, the plugin would use the marks that have been configured in OpenCPN core directly.</p>

<p>I am seeking feedback on ideas, historical context and opinions before I do anything.<br>
Thank you. Sebastien</p>

<p>This is a great idea.  I've been confused by the multiple stores on many occasions, and removing the duplication has been on my todo list too.  I will take a look at the detail of your proposal.  Another aspect that comes to mind is the ability to directly use locations stored in the vector charts.  Right now, to route from Harbor A to Harbor B, one has to create redundant markers for Harbor A and Harbor B, even if those are very well-defined locations in the vector charts.  I'll add all my consolidated comments to issue 221.</p>
