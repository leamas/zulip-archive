<p>I am proposing to simplify "position" management in the weather routing plugin.  This would eliminate having a copy of the list positions in the plugin. Instead, the plugin would use the marks that have been configured in OpenCPN core directly.</p>

<p>I am seeking feedback on ideas, historical context and opinions before I do anything.<br>
Thank you. Sebastien</p>

<p>This is a great idea.  I've been confused by the multiple stores on many occasions, and removing the duplication has been on my todo list too.  I will take a look at the detail of your proposal.  Another aspect that comes to mind is the ability to directly use locations stored in the vector charts.  Right now, to route from Harbor A to Harbor B, one has to create redundant markers for Harbor A and Harbor B, even if those are very well-defined locations in the vector charts.  I'll add all my consolidated comments to issue 221.</p>

I had an idea we could try. from "improve" branch, Git checkout "test" <br>
The make a PR to "test" and see how it builds.<br>
Let's do that now ok. I think I can handle it using Quinton's fork.</p>
<p>Also we have WR 1.15.21.22 now with 13 builds and just 3 fails.<br>
Should I push that up to plugin beta catalog?</p>
<p>The deploy landed here in Cloudsmith (with a search just for the 1.15.21.22 + tarball<br>
<a href="https://cloudsmith.io/~opencpn/repos/weather-routing-beta/packages/?q=1.15.21.22+tarball">https://cloudsmith.io/~opencpn/repos/weather-routing-beta/packages/?q=1.15.21.22+tarball</a></p>
<p>You can download the right file for your OS and "Import Tarball"</p>
<p>By the way, I've created Browser bookmarks in a dropdown menu for all the urls I need for Opencpn, plugins, CI builds etc. It is all in one place. Then with PW management on it gets easier.</p>

<p>Thanks Rick.  I think that's already happening with my PR 230 (<a href="https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/pull/230">https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/pull/230</a>)?</p>
<p>Or perhaps you're planning to add more stuff to the "test" branch you're proposing?</p>

<p>Actually, see below.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sebastien-rosset">@sebastien-rosset</a> <a href="https://github.com/quinton-hoole">@quinton-hoole</a> I have not merged this. Please do not merge it.<br>
I have created a new branch called "test" which I have already <strong>merged</strong> with a new PR Quinton's from his remote improve branch. See <a href="https://github.com/rgleason/weather_routing_pi/pull/252">#252</a></p>
<p>I may close this request to merge with my "improve" branch depending on what we find out.</p>
<p>You will find the built files (metadata and tarball) in cloudsmith weather-routing-alpha.  Search on 1.15.21.22 (space) tarball and download it and then from inside Opencpn  Options&gt;Pl &gt; Import Plugin Tarball.</p>
<p>You many need to set the catalog to expert  (Search on the FAQs in the Wiki for how to do that.</p>

<p>My first merged OpenCPN PR.  I might just celebrate with a beer :-)</p>
