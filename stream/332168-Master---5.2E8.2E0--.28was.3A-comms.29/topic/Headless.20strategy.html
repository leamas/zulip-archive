<p>I'm about to file a bunch of issues regarding the headless use case, mostly from <a href="https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/issues/3346">#3346</a>.  Many of these things is really about platform integration: devices which are attached while already started, how to initiate stop from outside, etc.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/issues/3349">#3349</a>. The solution for this is to use Dbus. I would say this is a no-brainer, using dbus instead of lock files resolves all otherwise tricky corner cases. Now, since this pulls in dbus anyway, we could of course use it also for other things.</p>
<p>Now, dbus is linux only. OTOH, I don't really see a windows or macos headless device,  so such functionality might be linux only anyway as I see it.</p>
<p>But that's just me. Thoughts?</p>
