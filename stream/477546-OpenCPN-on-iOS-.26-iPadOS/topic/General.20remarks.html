<p>Many users would like to have OpenCPN on Apple mobile devices - iOS and iPadOS.  We always say "no chance" and many advise to get an Android tablet instead.  This channel is a place to consider the issue and the hurdles.</p>

<p>I’d be very willing to collaborate on such an effort. I’m an experienced programmer, sailor and open source guy. I don’t know too much about iOS or wxWidgets, but I have time and am willing to figure it out. I think that having a solid version of OpenCPN on iOS/iPadOS would be quite valuable, </p>
<p>From what I understand (and I may be wrong about this) Apple were talking about unifying around an IOS-based os for all their devices (rather than, e.g. MacOS). So there might be long term value too. Does anyone know whether this rumor is still true?</p>

<p>Has any further consideration gone into this <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="554731">@Tony Voss</span> ?</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I compiled up the minimal sample wxWidgets iOS application and it worked out of the box.  I'm not sure what the delta is between which parts of wXWidgets are used by OpenCPN, and which parts are supported on iOS, but figuring that out seems like a  useful starting point?  Or is this a deadend conversation that's already been determined to never work?</p>
