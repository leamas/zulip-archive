<p>I have completed the Transpac 2025 using OpenCPN as one of the navigation systems aboard our Beneteau First 40. It was an absolute blast with lots of challenges and great memories, sailing from California to Hawaii in demanding offshore conditions. I'll provide detailed feedback on real-world offshore usage of OpenCPN, from a practical racing perspective.</p>
<h2>Context and Competition</h2>
<p>The professional and semi-professional boats were predominantly using commercial navigation software (Adrena and Expedition). Some of the skippers and navigators are world-class professionals with extensive offshore racing experience, with most crew members having highly specialized roles. We were not in that category, but we had tremendous fun nonetheless and proved that OpenCPN can be used effectively for offshore racing. </p>
<h2>Overall Assessment</h2>
<p>The combination of weather analysis, performance monitoring, and traditional navigation created a robust offshore sailing platform. OpenCPN worked well with few problems throughout most of the race, seamlessly integrating with our B&amp;G electronics and providing great navigation capabilities. The system performed well until laptop hardware failed due to seawater ingress during heavy weather - a scenario that highlighted both OpenCPN's strengths and areas for improvement.</p>
<p>During this real-world offshore race, I have identified specific enhancements that would significantly improve reliability and usability, particularly for offshore racing applications. The feedback comes from actual usage in challenging conditions with multiple crew members of varying technical expertise.</p>

<h2>Weather Routing Process</h2>
<p>We used the following process multiple times per day:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download GRIBs via Starlink</li>
<li>Analyze weather data in OpenCPN and Weather Fax plugin</li>
<li>Optionally create exclusion zones using OCPN Draw for zone avoidance</li>
<li>Create multiple weather routing scenarios using weather routing plugin with tactical considerations</li>
<li>Save multiple routes for comparison and analysis</li>
<li>Use timeline widget to visualize weather evolution and route performance over time</li>
<li>Manual route editing and optimization based on timeline analysis</li>
<li>Route activation with manual waypoint selection</li>
<li>Monitor performance via Dashboard plugin (polar data)</li>
<li>Use Tactics plugin for real-time layline calculations</li>
<li>Configure navigation data output (XTE, DTW, bearing) via YDNU-02 gateway</li>
<li>B&amp;G Zeus 3S and Triton displays receive OpenCPN navigation data as primary source</li>
<li>Crew uses navigation data on Triton display and verbal guidelines from the navigator.</li>
</ol>

<p>I monitored the polar performance via Dashboard plugin (performance of actual sailing versus polar data). Then I used the actual polar performance as a feedback loop to adjust configuration parameters in the weather routing.  For example, if I noticed for the past 3 hours the polar performance under symmetric spinnaker was 108%, I would use this to recalculate isochrons with these new polar settings in the weather routing plugin.</p>
<p>Related to this, it would be useful to enhance OpenCPN as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to easily assign who is at the helm and the sail plan.</li>
<li>Save event log with person at the helm and sail plan. This could be as part of the VDR plugin (or perhaps logbook plugin). I tried to use the logbook plugin, but it causes too many crashes and it's too complicate to assign people</li>
<li>The tactics plugin could be improved to better show the polar performance: actual polar performance since last change of person at the helm, or last maneuver or last sail plan change. And average polar performance for the past X seconds/Y minutes. In addition, it would be good to show the polar performance for a given sail plan. Ie. in the weather routing plugin, it's possible to configure multiple polars (one per sail plan), but in the tactics plugin, you can only load one polar at a time.</li>
<li>In the weather routing plugin, it should be possible to:<br>
   a. specify the performance rating per sail plan. We were not doing great under jib, however our performance was pretty good under symmetric spinnaker with waves.<br>
   b. show the actual performance versus the plan.</li>
</ol>
