<p>Several issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rather confusing information on screen.<br>
What does the following mean (ie. the ERALL in the following)<br>
n0183-RPM ERRPM $ERRPM,E,0,2000,,A*42&lt;0D&gt;&lt;0A&gt;<br>
n0183-ALL ERALL $ERRPM,E,0,2000,,A*42&lt;0D&gt;&lt;0A&gt;<br>
n0183-ALL ERALL $ERRPM,E,0,2000,,A*42&lt;0D&gt;&lt;0A&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Output formats (at least in copy to clipboard)<br>
NMEA 0183, currently <br>
Suggest reverting to the format previously implemented in the NMEA Debug Window, where leading and trailing metadata was stripped, leaving just simple NMEA 0183 text that could be copied into a parser/decoder.<br>
Eg. $ERRPM,E,0,2000,,A*42<br>
Similarly for NMEA 2000, suggest dumping in candump format rather than some obfuscated Actisense format (with the leading Acisense RX command identifier). Even I might struggle to understand what this is and that is saying something!<br>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Also suggest that for both internal OpenCPN messages and SignalK that copy to clipboard uses "pretty JSON" so that it is more readable.</p>
<p>Log to file, header doesn't seem to make sense especially msg_type and source.<br>
For example:<br>
received_at,protocol,msg_type,source,raw_data<br>
7760625,NMEA0183,UDP:0.0.0.0:10110,GPALL,"$GPGGA,131855,3831.57,S,14422.13,E,1,10,0.98,1113.0,M,-21.3,M,25,10*75&lt;0D&gt;&lt;0A&gt;"</p>
<p>Is the header meant to indicate: msg type = UDP:0.0.0.0:10110 and  Src = GPALL</p>
<p>Dialog &amp; usability. I guess enough time before the next release to cleanup the layout.<br>
Separate Stop/Start and Resume/Stop button ? Kind of confusing, I don't know what the start stop button does, couldn't tell if it stopped/started writing to log file. The Resume/Stop pauses the display on screen, but should be labelled Pause/Resume.<br>
The view option raises a context menu "Standard Colours,No Colours, Copy to Clipboard"<br>
Basic usability. First of all raisinga context menu from a button is just plain wrong. Copy to Clipboard should either be its own button or a context menu item raised from a right click on the display. Standard Colours, No colours, When you have a choice of an option, it should be a single checkbox or checked context menu item (Use Colours). There is no need to have a an option No Colours, it is inferred if Use Colours is not selected..</p>

<p>The three fields are message key, type and data.  I have a new Filter option under way where these are needed and sort of obvious. leaving this as-is for now.</p>
<p>The "copy" thing is really hard to make in different ways for different message types  when they are intermixed. Anything is possible, but perhaps better left to a later step. </p>
<p>When it comes to logging we need as much data as possible which can be post processed. That said, this needs to be documented, will do at some point.</p>

<p>Agreed, will do.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It has working tooltips,  including "Set log file to enable", "Click to start logging" and "Click to stop logging" depending on state.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I have envisioned other color schemes, that's why it is like this. Let's see where it lands.</p>
<p>Using  right-click to pop up the menu  including "Copy" actually  seems like sound. I'll sleep on it.</p>
<p>Thanks for input!</p>
