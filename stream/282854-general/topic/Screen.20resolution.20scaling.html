<p>To handle high resolution screens, some builds need to be aware.<br>
wxWidgets provides methods <code>GetDPIScaleFactor()</code>, <code>FromDIP()</code> and <code>ToDPI()</code> for this.</p>
<p><strong>Windows</strong><br>
This works as expected.</p>
<p><strong>MacOS</strong><br>
MacOS takes care of screen resolution at system level, so no action is needed.<br>
<code>FromDIP()</code> and <code>ToDPI()</code> simply return the same wxPoint or wxSize unchanged.<br>
Surprisingly, <code>GetDPIScaleFactor()</code> does return the screen resolution (2 for a Retina display) so we have to not use that for MacOS.</p>
<p><strong>Bullseye</strong><br>
Some builds are OK (wx32 ones) but some fail (armhf, arm64)</p>
<p><strong>Buster-armhf </strong><br>
Fails</p>
<p>The reason for the fails is that the <code>GetDPIScaleFactor()</code>, <code>FromDIP()</code> and <code>ToDPI()</code> methods are not implemented in some cases.</p>
<p>I have dozens of these calls in the JavaScript plugin and to conditional compilation of each is not practical.  For my derived classes, I could provide dummy methods that do nothing.<br>
However, I sometimes use a class 'as is' such as the OCPN canvas window or wxWindow or wxFrame.<br>
To have to derive a class from these so that I can add the dummy methods seems unfortunate work and complication.</p>
<p>Any wisdom, please?  And how does OCPN cope with this inconsistency?</p>

<p>I am a bit out of the loop, but perhaps you can provide your own wrapper of GetDPIScaleFactor, eg ocpnGetDPIScaleFactor as a global function, or a member of a global class instead?</p>

<p>On those Linux builds without wx32 any high resolution screen will not work properly, for years I'd see OpenCPN charts tucked into one quarter of the window. So on those platforms, a dummy method that just returns "1" or the original wxPoint/wxSize would be OK I think.</p>

<p>But sorry, no direct answer to your question.</p>

<p>I have never worked with this suff. That said, I think I'd leave buster and bullseye-wx30 builds out of the loop initially, focus on wx32 for now. wx30 is old and will not be updated in any way now when wx32 is out.</p>
