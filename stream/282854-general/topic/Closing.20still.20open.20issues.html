<p>The OpenCPN gitHub repo has 261 issues still open.  Many have been resolved or implemented in released versions.<br>
Important active issues are lost many pages down in the list.</p>
<p>Please can everyone view the issues they have raised and mark as complete those that are?  That way the deck will be cleared to prepare for the next release.</p>
