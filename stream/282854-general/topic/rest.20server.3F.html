<p>I am considering using the rest server as an endpoint for wms requests, however it seems to generate certificates for the first ip number found but listen on all, and postman dislikes communicating on that ip (most likely a tls hiccup)<br>
Is there any way to make the rest server play nice or have i hit a dead end?</p>

<p>hm... this eventually  trickles down into the mongoose library. Even if I have coded large parts of the rest server I have actually no idea. Can you describe a test case I can reproduce?</p>
<p>BTW: welcome on board!</p>

<p>Thank <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="399510">@Alec Leamas</span> </p>
<p>I spend an hour thinking about how to get code in, and it feels a bit messy to piggyback on the rest_server.h / cpp. Instead I will create a parallel mongoose based unsecure wms "thing" and see if that will bring me in the right direction, at least my WMS mess will not mess up too much existing code.</p>
<p>However, a few things was confusing to me being a noob :-)<br>
The rest_server.h and cpp uses a call to get the physical ips like </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; ipv4_addrs = get_local_ipv4_addresses();
</code></pre></div>
<p>screenshot:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/33951/CaqVuA3V7RVqe_19UwAG7HIE/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/33951/CaqVuA3V7RVqe_19UwAG7HIE/image.png" title="image.png"><img data-original-dimensions="988x326" src="/user_uploads/thumbnail/33951/CaqVuA3V7RVqe_19UwAG7HIE/image.png/840x560.webp"></a></div><p>where the first IP is used for certificate generation. So hitting the rest interface has to happen on the correct ip from a browser.  The cert is most likely not signed for modern browsers - I can only trick Firefox into eating it, Chromium based refuses it, most likely the more recent annoying requirements for self signing certificates. If the cert can be signed with [alt_names] from a cfg file then all the ips and localhost could be added - all interfaces (0.0.0.0) seems to be opened.</p>
<p>Besides, all the traffic would then be send through a physical nic instance (not hitting the cable unless unlucky) but it is most likely more expensive than 127.0.0.1 that is usually optimized.  I don't know how much traffic comes through the rest interface, it might not be worth fixing.</p>
<p>The RestServer constructor also seems (two breakpoints in VS2022) to be called before the portable flag is parsed, so the :8443 port is always used.</p>
<p>Regards Laro88</p>
