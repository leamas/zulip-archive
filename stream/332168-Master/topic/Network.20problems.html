About Windows suspend/hibernation issues for TCP connections.<br>
We have some discussions on the CF and more about this.<br>
It's of course connected to the general (Win?) timeout issue where I after diskussions with Pavel made the PR <a href="https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/issues/3356">#3356</a>.<br>
Now to test if Win suspend is well detected I made some test hacks that's working good. TCP connections are restarted after a suspend resume.  See attached Git diff.<br>
The ideas mentioned in ocpn_frame.cpp: 6955:<br>
      g_pMUX-&gt;ClearStreams();    and  g_pMUX-&gt;StartAllStreams();<br>
would of course be two valuable funktions if established.</p>
<p>My ideas with the hack in the diff file is just to verify the detection of the Win suspend method. <br>
The result is clear from the log:  (the "Reconnect after Windows suspend" comes from my hack.)<br>
So, I think the Win hibernation issue would be rather easy to solve?</p>

<p>I can see also a SignalK connection doesn't reconnect  after a Win hibernation/suspend. Bu there I can't find a watchdog handling to "hack" in the same way as for TCP(N0183)?</p>

About TCP connection and comm_drv_n0183_net.cpp.<br>
I've a constant log flood caused by the 5 seconds, nothing received, timer. (m_dog_value = N_DOG_TIMEOUT)<br>
One TCP feed don't send that much data. Some AIS targets now and then. Upstart log below.<br>
Two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why a time out on 5 seconds? My connection example is nothing strange. In a boat you can by TCP connect an AIS receiver seeing only one target. A class B updates every 3 to 5 minutes. This should not cause any failure action or reconnect?</li>
<li>Why do we at all monitor the the TCP data flow? Is there not a general socket handling for TCP taking care of the connection and request a at live respons every now and then? Do we have to redo that?<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code> 22:07:49.459 MESSAGE comm_drv_n0183_net.cpp:541 TCP NetworkDataStream connection established: TCP:92.39.188.126:11101

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="522486">@Håkan Svensson</span> <br>
I understand the issue.<br>
I never imagined a TCP connection providing only one AIS-B target, without any AIVDO messages.  Of course this will time-out every 5 seconds.<br>
I believe that we need some sort of watchdog on TCP connections.  The case I think of is when one has a local OCPN server which provides NMEA service to possibly a number of OCPN clients, also local.  In fact, this is my "everyday" mode for testing.  If the server should die, I want the clients to reconnect automatically when the server returns to life.</p>
<p>How to handle?<br>
Perhaps simply throttle the log messages, allow only one log event per (example) 5 minutes after the first is issued?  <br>
Or more clever:  Measure the average time interval between TCP incoming messages, and compute the watchdog timeout value dynamically as some multiple of the average message interval?</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

When I refererad to any kind of "inbound" keep alive methods it was something like discussed <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37917947/when-is-a-tcp-connection-considered-idle">here</a> and <a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K13004262">here</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't know we need to handle a TCP idle timeout in the program like we do now. (UDP is different. He just wait?)<br>
But if so a longer upstart dog time and then a dynamic timer sounds of course efficient if worth the efforts. But then we may need one timer for every single TCP connection? (May be complex.)<br>
My example with one class B target, wo VDO, is not usual but still it can be long time idle sometimes. My own log flooding was solved by setting the dog to 15 seconds. <br>
I suppose the present 5 second was meant to be shorter than the former 6 seconds GPS-dog, now prolonged to 10 seconds (and 20 at start up)? So if nothing else we may consider lengthen the TCP dog accordingly?</p>
