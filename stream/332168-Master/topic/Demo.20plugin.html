<p>Happy to help and deconstruct my plugin. But after the new year.  Little interest in writing a new plugin or adding stuff I've already written, into the built in "demo" plugin even if there are plans to convert ithe demo plugin into a third party plugin.</p>
<p>However I do need to question why the need to do this? Aside from you &amp; Sebastien how many new developers have expressed an interest in developing or maintaining plugins?</p>
<p>Many of us contributed to writing the user manual but disappointingly few seemed to read it.</p>

<p>Understood. Good questions. Dave and Alec seem to think it would be a good idea to demonstrate what kinds of things a plugin can do via the plugin api, and how to do them. And to make it easy for someone wanting to develop a plugin to get productive. </p>
<p>My personal motivations go beyond that. Roughly speaking… </p>
<ol>
<li>I have a few plugins I’d like to develop. But first gaining familiarity with the plugin API, plugin build and test process etc will make it easier to design and build those plugins appropriately. </li>
<li>I also would like to tidy up the plugin api. There seems to be a lot of old cruft in there that makes plugin development and maintenance more difficult than necessary. To do that properly I need to understand the whole api as it stands today, warts and all, and with hands-on experience using all of it. </li>
<li>I’ve seen quite a few cases where changes to the API are made without proper testing against real plugins that use the api, leading to downstream breakages in plugins. So I’d like there to be a “test plugin” that can automatically exercise the whole API, to help pick up regressions in the API, and perhaps even in OpenCPN itself. I could potentially eventually use the plugin API to “drive” OpenCPN core, to perform system tests. It’s not really designed for that, but it might be a good start. </li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that makes sense.</p>

<p>This is IMHO the big question.</p>
<p>We actually have a <strong>lot</strong> of users and an open code base. Normally, this should attract some devs now and then.  Obviously, this fails for us.</p>
<p>When I try to take a step back and look at this project with the eyes of a prospective plugin dev I see a mess of documentation, testplugin and shipdriver, cloudsmith, circleci and what not. I think it would scare me away. </p>
<p>Compare this to a usual instructions for many projects out there like  <code>git clone,;cd whatever; ./configure; make; sudo make install</code>. That is, an easy-straight-forward path to create something you can test. When you dip your toes in the water of a new project, this is exactly what you you want to do. Or?</p>
<p>Now, if we focus on shipdriver (we should) this is actually likewise simple, ending up in a instruction how to import a plugin. This part should IMHO be the "front page" of the plugin project, directly visible in the README. It should be short enough to not scare anyone away. </p>
<p>If the prospective dev starts asking question abdout CI builds and publishing in the catalog she is already on the hook and these docs could be much less prominent, available as links</p>

Agree.<br>
For me, I'd look for a demo or sample that takes care of all the setup and dependencies.  I would hope to find a few simple entry points where I could start experimenting in a local clone. I would also hope that the code will be almost "baby-talk" style, not using the most cutting edge features of c++, but simple extremely literal code constructs that almost any dev could understand immediately.  Think "Hello world" style.</p>

<p>Hi Alec. I mostly agree with you. Except I’m not sure that build deps on the dev machine are necessarily the right approach.   Developers install all sorts of things on their dev machines. And are installing new stuff constantly. Those things may or may not clash with whatever OpenCPN or plugins want in order to build correctly. Would it not be better to build in containers? That way, the container would contain  precisely what is needed - no more, no less. </p>
<p>I think I saw build instructions somewhere for building in a container, but they are not very prominent, nobody seems to use them, and I suspect that only works for Linux. Should container builds not be the default way to build?</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I agree. A written tutorial (or alternatively extensive in-code comments) in a github repo, containing a working plugin with no more than a single page of well-commented code that (for example) displays "Hello World" on a chart might be a good start. Then incremental steps from there to do additional things like add dialogs, or whatever.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is in fact a good starting point:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agree on what the user experience will be for that first "Hello World" plugin.  As a strawman, I propose the new developer be allowed to build on either Linux, Windows or Mac, and not have to install any dependencies on their machine (i.e. use a container to build).  And they should not have to solve the complexities of building OpenCPN from source.  They should be able to import their plugin into the latest standard released OpenCPN download.</li>
<li>Agree on roughly what the following tutorials would be.  (2) Draw a shape on a chart? (3) Add a configurable option for the plugin? (4) Display output from the plugin in a separate window?</li>
</ol>

<p>Just a wild thought here. If we had a well-defined and clean interface description and documented minimum plug-in requirements, it ought to be possible to ask a good AI to write a "Hello World" plugin and generate something that works. You could know your documentation/interface description is adequate if an AI can take it and create a runnable plugin project based on an example prompt. So, while not as much fun, it might make good sense to focus on written plugin requirements and clearer API documentation before writing a hello world plugin. If an AI cannot write a simple runnable "hello world" plugin based on the written requirements/documentation, then probably a human cannot do it very well either.</p>
