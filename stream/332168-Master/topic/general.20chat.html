<p>I tried out Windows containers on Windows yesterday and they didn’t work on my pretty standard Lenovo Windows laptop. I followed the Docker and Microsoft instructions, was prompted to enable Hyper-V, which took a long time me and then failed without an explanation. It’s possibly because I’m not running a “Professional” or “Enterprise” version of Windows. Anyhow, in theory it seems very useful, but in practise I didn’t work. Maybe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="522729">@Dan Dickey</span> our windows boffin can give it a try. Unfortunately it doesn’t sound useful for our use case. <br>

<p>I also tried MacOS containers on MacOS. Unfortunately those are only supported on the upcoming MacOS 26, which is available in beta, but I shied away from that. Interesting project though, and open source. <a href="https://github.com/apple/container">https://github.com/apple/container</a>. </p>
<p>Linux containers ran just fine on Linux,  Windows  and MacOS though, using Docker. Probably not super useful though, as Alec suggested above. So I conclude that we’re probably stuck with local, non-containerized builds, unfortunately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's as if no one realizes that for Windows we have a local build script that does all the gathering of dependencies and sets up the entire build</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least I am aware of this, and it's indeed a nice script.</p>
<p>However, it's for building the core OpenCPN. The subject here is to build a basic "hello  world" plugin, a different use case.</p>
<p>Although this could be discussed I <strong>think</strong> that for Windows we want to avoid building both OpenCPN and wxWidgets and use pre compiled binaries  for the basic demo build. </p>
<p>That said, we definitely need something similar as for OpenCPN in a next step: Rebuilding opencpn + it's deps and setup VS so there is a more realistic plugin development environment.  Probably best avoided for "hello world", though.</p>
