The manual prescribes this:<br>\n<code>listener.Listen(id.key(), EVT_SHIPDRIVER, this);</code><br>\nbut there is no  Listen method .  The example I have found in dashboard_pi uses:<br>\n<code>listener_rpm = std::move(GetListener(id_rpm, EVT_183_RPM, this));</code><br>\nwhich fits with <code>GetListener</code> declared in ocpn_plugin.h</p>\n<p>Can SKS please update the manual to fit with reality?</p>\n<p>I have copied the relevant code for NMEA0183 from dashboard_pi into my plugin but it failing to match the GetListener call, so  there may be more than just the Listen line that needs updating.</p>",
