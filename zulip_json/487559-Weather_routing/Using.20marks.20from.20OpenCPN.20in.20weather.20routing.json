The some of the terminology I heard above is a bit confusing and not really in conformance with the standards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"399865\">Rick Gleason</span> </p>\n<p>I think the following comment I made on Sebastien's code sums up a useful point.  I'll copy it here for further discussion:</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what the right answer is here, but it seems like there are a few different ways we could approach naming in general here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use commonly understood terms, even if they are confusing and/or inconsistent. e.g. is SPEED_OVER_GROUND the speed of the boat, the speed of the wind, the speed of the water, or the speed of something else? Convention says that it's the speed of the boat of course, but it's clearly ambiguous.</li>\n<li>Use a systematic and correct way of describing these things, for example (using most significant term &gt; least significant term, but this could be changed):<br>\n  BOAT_SPEED_OVER_GROUND<br>\n  WIND_SPEED_OVER_GROUND<br>\n  WIND_DIRECTION_OVER_WATER<br>\n  etc.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure about that one. \"SOG\" has a very specific meaning in sailing and everybody uses that term. When people say SOG, it always means the speed of the boat over ground. There is no ambiguity that it could be wind.<br>\nSo when there is a standard term, we should use it and not qualify it, unless somehow there is a really good reason to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the UI, I think you're absolutely right.  For variable names in the code, I think it's worth thinking about. Not only for a particular variable like SOG, but also more generally. If I'm writing code, and I need two variables, one to represent boat speed over ground, and another to represent wind speed over ground, what should the two variable names be?  If we follow <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/issues/2\">#2</a> above it's obvious (BOAT_SPEED_OVER_GROUND and WIND_SPEED_OVER_GROUND).  If we follow # 1 above, it's less clear. SOG and TWS?  As we've determined, TWS is ambiguous, so it could mean WIND_SPEED_OVER_WATER or WIND_SPEED_OVER_GROUND.  So now we need to make up a non-ambiguous term for it. </p>\n<p>I'm not wedded to either system, but I don't think that the answer is trivially that we should use <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/issues/1\">#1</a>, because it's both internally inconsistent, and ambiguous, so then you need to augment it with other rules to solve those problems.</p>",

People use TWD, TWS, TWA, etc. <br>\nBTW, I checked my B&amp;G and there are two modes of operations for TWS and TWS: one mode gives the TWD with the ground as a frame of reference, and the other mode gives the values with water as a frame of reference. So yes in that case there can be a bit of ambiguity when people use TWD and TWS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, that's exactly my point. I think the reason you originally started renaming things is that some of the terms were ambiguous.  I agree, and I think it's a good idea to remove all ambiguity.</p>",
