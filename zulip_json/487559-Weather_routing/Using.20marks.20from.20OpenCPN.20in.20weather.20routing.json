I will take a look at the detail of your proposal.  Another aspect that comes to mind is the ability to directly use locations stored in the vector charts.  Right now, to route from Harbor A to Harbor B, one has to create redundant markers for Harbor A and Harbor B, even if those are very well-defined locations in the vector charts.  I'll add all my consolidated comments to issue 221.</p>",
