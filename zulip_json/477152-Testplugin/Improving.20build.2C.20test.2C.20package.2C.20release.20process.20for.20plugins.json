Then I'll take a closer look at Shipdriver. The way that testplugin has been used in weather_routing_pi over time makes the build and test process difficult to understand and debug.  I understand it's also difficult to incorporate updates in testpluging into weather_routing_pi.  Perhaps Shipdriver solves some of those issues.  Either way, reading up about Shipdriver is good education for me :-)</p>",
