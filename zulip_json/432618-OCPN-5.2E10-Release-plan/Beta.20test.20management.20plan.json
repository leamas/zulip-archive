What/how much of the new docs will be included in the release bundle?  etc..  We will work those issues in parallel, while we test the Beta for other functional problems.</p>\n<p>Thoughts on this process, or anything else I may have forgotten about, now is a good time to discuss.</p>\n<p>If all looks good, we will start the process on 9 June, 2024<br>\nDave</p>",
