I know about the arguments behind the redesign but I still find it tedious.  The workaround of just copying the updated binary into place is unsatisfactory as installs also update other files.<br>\nSo while developing a plugin, I revert to v5.8.  There I can repeatedly import a local build and then choose <em>Reinstall</em>, which is not available under v5.10.</p>",
