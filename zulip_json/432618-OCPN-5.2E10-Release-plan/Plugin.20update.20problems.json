I know about the arguments behind the redesign but I still find it tedious.  The workaround of just copying the updated binary into place is unsatisfactory as installs also update other files.<br>\nSo while developing a plugin, I revert to v5.8.  There I can repeatedly import a local build and then choose <em>Reinstall</em>, which is not available under v5.10.</p>",

If so, it would be helpful to know more specifics about the modification.</p>\n<p>While this is an issue, I find generally that the overall PI interface is getting better and more mature, and apart from Tony's issue, the update arrow and needing a better process to Import Plugins for Android, I think it is pretty good.</p>",
