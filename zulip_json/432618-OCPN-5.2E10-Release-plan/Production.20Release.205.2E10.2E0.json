So, theoretically if something went wild in the SENC thread and corrupted the main thread image, it could explain the fault.<br>\nSo I hacked the code so that SENC file creation threads start on every chart load, just to stress the system.  Ran without problem for 60 minutes.  So....<br>\nHave you ever seen a similar log case before?  In normal operation, multithread SENC file creation is pretty infrequent, happens only when a chartset is initially installed, or updated.</p>",

I am beginning to think that this all has nothing to do with OCPN.  The AISAlertDialog may be just a signal of more fundamental memory problems on your machine.  We have chased it around, and now it has gone back into hiding, only to surface somewhere else completely unrelated.
