This should be our primary development branch.</li>\n<li>The v3.2 branch is supposed to contain cherry-picked commits from master which might end up in a 3.2.2 release.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please rebase or pull master to get in sync.</p>\n<p>I suggest that we try to organize this in  a way that you are responsible for the master branch while I take care of the v3.2 branch. This would mean that I avoid making direct pushes to master, using PRs  instead. OTOH, I just push to v3.2. OK?</p>\n<p>Sorry for late pushes to master. The situation was a bit stressful when I realized that the release I just had announced actually used bogus tags (yes, it did). When you did not reply at once  I felt I had to act.  Let's hope something similar does not happen again.</p>",
