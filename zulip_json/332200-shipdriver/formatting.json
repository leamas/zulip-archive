However, it's now on the table.</p>\n<p>As I said in your PR, the tool used in the OpenCPN core is clang-format. Looking at shipdriver, .clang-format is already in place so it should be simple to use it.  Using a single tool is just much simpler than trying to define formatting rules.</p>\n<p>The question is just how to best apply this to windows users whcih are lost in VS :). However, there seems to be a clang-format plugin available for VS. Perhaps you could make a test with that one, formatting some files?.</p>\n<p>Be prepared to that the formatting rules feels a bit awkward in the beginning, that was my experience. However, one get's used to it quite fast, took some days for me. And nothing in this formatting is set in stone, it's only about .clang-format which could be tweaked in all sorts of ways. However,  better to avoid that.</p>",

Anyway, we can put this behind us as I presumed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Indentation with Google style is 3 spaces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, it's 2, see <a href=\"https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html\">https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html</a>. If it is anything else, it's not google.  The core issue here is that .clang-format isn't used, probably  because the VS plugin tries to mimic clang-format rather than actuallly running it. Installing clang-format as of above should do the trick</p>",
