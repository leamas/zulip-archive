The interesting part for us is how to manage the different API levels.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking about  a new branch structure. Let's call them api-16, api-18 and api-19 (out ot the top of my head...). I'm thinking as I write, please bear with me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>api-16 represents the  buster frozen builds.</li>\n<li>api-18 represents the builds  we do today, supported from 5.10</li>\n<li>api-19 represents the  bleeding edge supported from 5.12.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, as Dave said, for Shipdriver as such the api-19 branch is perhaps not that useful, we only need api-18. But shipdriver is also a template, and from that perspective we need to care about plugins  using api-19.</p>\n<p>Next step would be to determine  a builds per branch matrix, something like:</p>\n<p>*api-18:  windows, MacOS, android...<br>\n*api-19: debian 13 , all incarnations. Notably tracks the new api-19 branch in opencpn-libs.<br>\n*api-16; The frozen windows and buster builds.</p>\n<p>When we build the api-18 branch we basically build everything we  build today, with the exception that the frozen builds are not updated which makes for a simpler PR workflow.</p>\n<p>When we build the api-19 branch this is the development branch where we can test things, notably Trixie.</p>\n<p>api-16 is basically never built, but could theoretically be patched  to solve something and rebuilt.</p>\n<p>Practically, after the 5.12 release we wouild work on the api-19 branch,  buit cherrypicking more or less everything to api-18. </p>\n<p>Vague ideas so far.  Thoughts?</p>",
