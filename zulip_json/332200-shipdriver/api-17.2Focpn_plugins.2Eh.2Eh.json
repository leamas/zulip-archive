On the contrary, each and every commit in such a branch should</p>\n<ul>\n<li>already exist in master</li>\n<li>have a reference to a bug in the description</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I see that you have made some commits here,  for example some <a href=\"http://safe.directory\">safe.directory</a> tests. The result is that the sd3.2.2 tag is no longer on the branch. This is no big deal,just somewhat annoying.</p>\n<p>I suggest that when you need to test things like we all do, use a separate branch for that. circle/config.yml is set up to build basically all branches, so when you push a branch  it will be built (the exception is a branch named \"tmp\"). This way, you can test things without cluttering the history.</p>\n<p>When done, make a clean change to master. Next step is to cherry-pick this change into v3.2. At some point I will show you how to do it, until then I can fix it. This way, we can keep the conservative approach we should to a release branch.</p>",
