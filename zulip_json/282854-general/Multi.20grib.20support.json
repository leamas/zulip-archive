Should I plan to discuss and make changes in the existing grib plugin? Or create a new multi-grib plugin? Enhancing the existing plugin seems the right thing to do, but perhaps there are reasons not. Or perhaps I should do both. Thank you. Sebastien</p>",

I'm thinking about being able to load both a 48-hour HRRR model and GFS/ECMWF model, then do an isochron computation that takes HRRR for more precise routing. Or quickly comparing different models to check if they show dissimilarities. AFAIK, loading 2 models that have the same parameter type (e.g. wind or wind gust) isn't well supported.</p>",
