May I suggest that we apply some simple (but actually quite strict) rules for this branch? </p>\n<ol>\n<li>All new commits goes into master. v5.8.x only contains cherry-picked commits from master.</li>\n<li>All commits in v5.8.x should have a bug reference.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are traditional rules for release branches. The first rule makes sure that v5.8.x does not diverge from master with new funcitonality, we don't want that. The second makes sure that all commits in v5.8.x fixes a documented problem </p>\n<p>THoughts?</p>",
