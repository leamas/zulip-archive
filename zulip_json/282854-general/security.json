As Dave pointed out, as long as the protocol does not have any security provisions, the simple fact is that it is possible to spoof messages. This is the situation for \"standard\" AIS data.</p>\n<p>If there is a need to block this possibility I also don't see that encryption is meaningful. After all, the problem is to verify that the received data is correct rather than to keep it private (?)</p>\n<p>Which boils down to that a possible solution to this would be to sign each sent message using standard public key tools, and that the receiving side verifies the signature. This would make it possible for a receiver to check if  the AIS  sender is legitimate. </p>\n<p>For the receivers, this would mean they  would have to maintain a list of good public keys representing known good data sources. This list might need tools to be updated.</p>\n<p>For the senders, it means using a secret key in the deployment process. In general, this is more complicated -- how complicated depends on the use case. </p>\n<p>The problem to verify data is actually a standard one, and signatures  is the standard way to solve it.</p>\n<p>Just my 5 Ã¶re...</p>",
