        "content": "<p>I have completed the Transpac 2025 using OpenCPN as one of the navigation systems aboard our Beneteau First 40. It was an absolute blast with lots of challenges and great memories, sailing from California to Hawaii in demanding offshore conditions. I'll provide detailed feedback on real-world offshore usage of OpenCPN, from a practical racing perspective.</p>\n<h2>Context and Competition</h2>\n<p>The professional and semi-professional boats were predominantly using commercial navigation software (Adrena and Expedition). Some of the skippers and navigators are world-class professionals with extensive offshore racing experience, with most crew members having highly specialized roles. We were not in that category, but we had tremendous fun nonetheless and proved that OpenCPN can be used effectively for offshore racing. </p>\n<h2>Overall Assessment</h2>\n<p>The combination of weather analysis, performance monitoring, and traditional navigation created a robust offshore sailing platform. OpenCPN worked well with few problems throughout most of the race, seamlessly integrating with our B&amp;G electronics and providing great navigation capabilities. The system performed well until laptop hardware failed due to seawater ingress during heavy weather - a scenario that highlighted both OpenCPN's strengths and areas for improvement.</p>\n<p>During this real-world offshore race, I have identified specific enhancements that would significantly improve reliability and usability, particularly for offshore racing applications. The feedback comes from actual usage in challenging conditions with multiple crew members of varying technical expertise.</p>",
