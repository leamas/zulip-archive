So many moving parts, testing at each step.  But I'll say that each release gets a bit easier as we improve and stabilize the tooling.<br>\nI plan to create a new branch called \"v5.8.x\" wherein we can confine and manage any backport activity on O58, and allow us to play in master as a WIP sandbox.  I'd be very surprised if we do not find the need for a 5.8.2 update.<br>\nCheers</p>",
