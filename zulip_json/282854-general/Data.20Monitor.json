Even I might struggle to understand what this is and that is saying something!<br>\n1 <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/commit/93120411f201ff04000000000700d430ffffffff49\">93120411f201ff04000000000700d430ffffffff49</a><br>\n1 <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/commit/93130412f101ff050000000008e06d22c504680301a2\">93130412f101ff050000000008e06d22c504680301a2</a><br>\n1 <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/commit/93120419f101ff050000000007e011005d010b02e5\">93120419f101ff050000000007e011005d010b02e5</a><br>\n129025 <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/commit/93130401f801ff090000000008dbf637e95cf636567d\">93130401f801ff090000000008dbf637e95cf636567d</a><br>\n129026 <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/commit/93110402f801ff090000000006df001622020234\">93110402f801ff090000000006df001622020234</a><br>\n127488 <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/commit/93120400f201ff02000000000700481fffffff7f79\">93120400f201ff02000000000700481fffffff7f79</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also suggest that for both internal OpenCPN messages and SignalK that copy to clipboard uses \"pretty JSON\" so that it is more readable.</p>\n<p>Log to file, header doesn't seem to make sense especially msg_type and source.<br>\nFor example:<br>\nreceived_at,protocol,msg_type,source,raw_data<br>\n7760625,NMEA0183,UDP:0.0.0.0:10110,GPALL,\"$GPGGA,131855,3831.57,S,14422.13,E,1,10,0.98,1113.0,M,-21.3,M,25,10*75&lt;0D&gt;&lt;0A&gt;\"</p>\n<p>Is the header meant to indicate: msg type = UDP:0.0.0.0:10110 and  Src = GPALL</p>\n<p>Dialog &amp; usability. I guess enough time before the next release to cleanup the layout.<br>\nSeparate Stop/Start and Resume/Stop button ? Kind of confusing, I don't know what the start stop button does, couldn't tell if it stopped/started writing to log file. The Resume/Stop pauses the display on screen, but should be labelled Pause/Resume.<br>\nThe view option raises a context menu \"Standard Colours,No Colours, Copy to Clipboard\"<br>\nBasic usability. First of all raisinga context menu from a button is just plain wrong. Copy to Clipboard should either be its own button or a context menu item raised from a right click on the display. Standard Colours, No colours, When you have a choice of an option, it should be a single checkbox or checked context menu item (Use Colours). There is no need to have a an option No Colours, it is inferred if Use Colours is not selected..</p>",
