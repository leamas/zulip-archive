So hitting the rest interface has to happen on the correct ip from a browser.  The cert is most likely not signed for modern browsers - I can only trick Firefox into eating it, Chromium based refuses it, most likely the more recent annoying requirements for self signing certificates. If the cert can be signed with [alt_names] from a cfg file then all the ips and localhost could be added - all interfaces (0.0.0.0) seems to be opened.</p>\n<p>Besides, all the traffic would then be send through a physical nic instance (not hitting the cable unless unlucky) but it is most likely more expensive than 127.0.0.1 that is usually optimized.  I don't know how much traffic comes through the rest interface, it might not be worth fixing.</p>\n<p>The RestServer constructor also seems (two breakpoints in VS2022) to be called before the portable flag is parsed, so the :8443 port is always used.</p>\n<p>Regards Laro88</p>",
