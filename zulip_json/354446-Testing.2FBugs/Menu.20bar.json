For example, when the AIS list is docked at the top of the window and the chart height changes, the menu bar does not drop down and ends up overlaying part of the AIS list.  A similar thing happens at startup if the horizontal Dashboard is docked at the top.  Resizing the entire windows fixes the problem so the toolbar code knows how to position, it but it must be some events such as docking are not trapped the way resize is handled.</p>",
