This is, on linux, <em>$base_plugin_path/../$libdir/opencpn</em>. <em>$base_plugin_path</em> is known, the installation path. In the standard  scenario it is <em>/usr/bin/opencpn</em>; viable alternatives includes <em>/usr/local/bin/opencpn</em>,  <em>/opt/opencpn/bin/opencpn</em> and what not. </p>\n<p>However, <em>$libdir</em> is problematic. It could at least be <em>lib</em> or <em>lib64</em>. On a Debian system it might even  be a triple like <em>x86_64-linux-gnu</em>. Our own  packages alway uses <em>lib</em>, though.</p>\n<p>We have the OPENCPN_PLUGIN_DIRS loophole, so we could probably get away with using just <em>lib</em>.</p>\n<p>TL; DR; we should add <em>$base_plugin_path/../lib/opencpn</em> to the search paths. </p>\n<p>OK?</p>",
