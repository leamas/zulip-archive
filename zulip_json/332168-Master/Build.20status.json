This fixes up any errant files in wxWidgets or the build tree. Also, allows you to “up/down size” the build tree to just the configurations you want. The ‘rebuild’ option only cleans and rebuilds the build folder without changing the types of configurations. It also saves the O configuration for deleted configs so if you later decide you want one back it can restore the configuration files.</p>\n<p>So ‘clean’ is pretty much a do-over from scratch without losing the confs. If you don’t give it any additions options it will build all 4 configurations same as initial run without options. If you want less than that, specify the configurations desired along with the ‘clean’ option.</p>\n<p>There is no option that will just “clean” like ‘make clean’. I was going to do that but it didn’t make sense because the initial install is necessary to set up the runtime environment. You cannot do anything useful with a “clean” build folder.</p>\n<p>If you don’t see the build tree disappear early in the ‘clean’ process something is wrong.</p>",
