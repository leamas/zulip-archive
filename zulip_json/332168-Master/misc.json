It allows all 4 different build types to coexist and you and jump between them at any time. Debugging is easy from inside Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>Plugin debugging is also simplified. Just install the plugin in the correct place (e.g. build\\Debug\\Plugins) and you can easily step into the plugin with full source code debugging. </p>\n<p>The -p option is what keeps all these building types isolated and functional. The -p option is created by the cmake file.</p>",
