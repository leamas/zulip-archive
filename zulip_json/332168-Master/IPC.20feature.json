The runtime system's  clean up of  static variables occurs after wxWidgets' clean  up of wxWidgets resources.

Global/static variables are evil, agreed (also true for singletons).  But  the c++ runtime is perfectly capable of invoking destructors on them on exit. Using these mechanisms it's possible to avoid the evil  raw pointers.</p>\n<p>So the  solution should IMHO be an internal pointer in IpcConnection which is possible to tear down at exit.  Basically a band aid for semi functional wxWidgets exit procedures.  And keep the overall reference handling of the objects which is much less error prone. </p>\n<p>Or?</p>",
