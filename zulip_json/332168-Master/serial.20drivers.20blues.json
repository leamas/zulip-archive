Your solution uses that knowledge (i.e. NMEA0183 message structure) to work around this config error.  Another solution is aggressive filtering.  In real life, both may be needed.</p>\n<p>Also related:  today, upstream clients of TX methods are generally not prepared to buffer and re-transmit erroneous or incomplete TX calls.  So detecting and ensuring transmission of TX messages by NMEA type is practically the only way to manage this situation, short of re-writing the clients.  We really should not drop things like autopilot commands.</p>\n<p>I'll spend some cycles thinking about the serial N2K equivalent case.</p>\n<p>So this is all well and good if it works.  I guess we should merge and be ready for some wider tests.</p>",

Seems like I'm the only  one which can reproduce the core problem.  </p>\n<p>As for N2k, we should definitely fix the partial writes and the static mentioned in <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/issues/3819\">#3819</a>, the easy path would be to copy paste changes from <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/issues/3819\">#3819</a> after more testing. This is a no brainer and the likely starting point.   </p>\n<p>What's left then is the synchronizing, or lack thereof, in SendMessage. Since there is no need to throttle  here this could be done much simpler, but still needs to be done.</p>",
