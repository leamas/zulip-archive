The main \"App\" is a Java native app running on Android OS.  All of the OCPN core support comes in as a solib, (<a href=\"http://libgorp.so\">libgorp.so</a>) which is brought into the image by a dlopen() call during initialization of the Android App..<br>\nAnd this is precisely why you saw the build time link errors when the OCPN library need an update to API118.  So, we caught link errors at build time, which is a good thing.<br>\nIncidentally, this is also why the plugins for Android need a SONAME definition for the OCPN core library.  The Android plugin is a .so library linking against, among other things, the OCPN core library, which is also an Android solib.</p>\n<p>So, the SONAME of \"<a href=\"http://libgorp.so\">libgorp.so</a>\" requirement for plugins is exclusive to Android builds.  This really clears up my thinking on this difference between plugin linux and Android builds.</p>",
