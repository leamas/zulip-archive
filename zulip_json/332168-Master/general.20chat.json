I followed the Docker and Microsoft instructions, was prompted to enable Hyper-V, which took a long time me and then failed without an explanation. It’s possibly because I’m not running a “Professional” or “Enterprise” version of Windows. Anyhow, in theory it seems very useful, but in practise I didn’t work. Maybe <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"522729\">@Dan Dickey</span> our windows boffin can give it a try. Unfortunately it doesn’t sound useful for our use case. <br>\n<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/</a></p>\n<p>I also tried MacOS containers on MacOS. Unfortunately those are only supported on the upcoming MacOS 26, which is available in beta, but I shied away from that. Interesting project though, and open source. <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/container\">https://github.com/apple/container</a>. </p>\n<p>Linux containers ran just fine on Linux,  Windows  and MacOS though, using Docker. Probably not super useful though, as Alec suggested above. So I conclude that we’re probably stuck with local, non-containerized builds, unfortunately.</p>",
