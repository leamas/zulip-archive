The overall connection is fine, the position works. But not SOG, XTE, etc.</p>\n<p>Looking at the RMB messages opencpn generates they look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>$ECRMB, A, 0.000, L, Begin, 005, 6527.552, N, 02235.795, E, 0.373, 271.336, 0.000, V, A*04\n$ECRMB, A, 0.000, L, Begin, 005, 6527.552, N, 02235.795, E, 12.926, 118.465, -0.000, V, A*1D&lt;0D&gt;&lt;0A&gt;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>My question is about the last part of that message: <code>0.000, V, A*04</code>  . Here 0.000 is the speed to waypoint, 0 since  I'm currently in harbour.  After this there is <code>V, A</code> and a checksum.</p>\n<p>However, when I look at the specs such as they are I only find one part, the arrival flag . It should at least be 'A' if n the arrival circle is entered. Some sources says it should be 'V' if not.</p>\n<p>But opencpn sends two fields: 'A', 'V'. Something is broken here:  me, specs or opencpn. </p>\n<p>Any hint out there?<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"522486\">@HÃ¥kan Svensson</span></p>",
