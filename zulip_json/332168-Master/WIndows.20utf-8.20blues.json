Now I have this snippet:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>static const auto kUtfGear = wxString::Format(&quot;%c&quot;, 0x2699);\nstatic const auto kUtfTrashbin = wxString::Format(&quot;%lc&quot;, 0x1f5d1);\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Of these, kUtfGear works fine. However, the 32-bit kUtfTrashbin fails miserably on Windows. Other platforms, at least  Linux, seems ok.</p>\n<p>Has anyone an idea how to handle utf codepoints with more than 16 bits on windows?</p>",
