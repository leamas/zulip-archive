Width is set by<br>\nJavaScriptgui_imp.h: 1039        int minWidth = 80 + mConsoleName.Length() * 8;<br>\nThis might need tweaking.</p>\n<p>Your screenshot looks like it was taken at the end of the test script.  The rightmost console has had its name changed from <code>ConsoleE</code> to <code>2</code> to check that the window is shrunk accordingly, which it appears not to have done.  I found it takes a moment for this to happen, so the test script has a delay built in to allow for it to happen.  Perhaps on Windows there is no automatic refresh?  You could try manually reducing that console by dragging it smaller to confirm the minimum width has been reduced to the correct size.  Alternatively, can you try doing something that causes a refresh to see whether that makes the shrinking apparent?</p>\n<p>Let me know if you want me to rebuild with changes. I would have to guess  changes to MIN_CONSOLE_HEIGHT as it needs trial and error.</p>",
