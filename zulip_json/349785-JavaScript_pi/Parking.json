Also you could set a console smaller than allowed by drag.  These probably explain why you could not get it working on Windows.</p>\n<p>I have now completely re-written that part.  It is much better, smaller, more understandable and hence more maintainable.  Only issue is that switching in or out of full screen mode unparks any parked consoles.  But I can live with that, at least until someone complains.</p>\n<p>I have also created a special script configParking.js which helps you work out the values to go in consolePositioning.h.  This virtually eliminates the need for trial and error compiling.  You will find it in the test scripts folder.  An extract fom the technical manual on this is attached.</p>\n<p>Best of luck and thanks<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/33951/HgMjDcSo9XRojWlH4s3gMilx/Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-17.50.39.png\">Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-17.50.39.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/33951/HgMjDcSo9XRojWlH4s3gMilx/Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-17.50.39.png\" title=\"Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-17.50.39.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/33951/HgMjDcSo9XRojWlH4s3gMilx/Screenshot-2023-01-12-at-17.50.39.png\"></a></div>",

You can customise the parking parameters, which will be remembered in the config file.  So each user can choose their own preferred place. You can also reveal the current parameters in the form needed for the <code>parkingConfig.h</code> file.  So to customise for a given platform, you customise so it work s optimally and can then copy out the settings to go in the <code>parkingConfig.h</code> file thus making them the default for that platform.

If you try to close a fulling minimised console if will grow anyway to show the message and the clear button.
