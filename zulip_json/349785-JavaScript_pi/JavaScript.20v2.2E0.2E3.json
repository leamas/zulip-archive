That now works fine.<br>\nSo the default parking parameters have to be redone.  I have built in defaults for MacOS Ventura.<br>\nMike - please use the utility tab in the plugin tools to get default parameters for Windows and Linux and send them to me.</p>\n<p>I have fixed the problem with child windows getting covered by the frame on MacOSn <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>\n<p>New builds in my Alpha repository just gone in.  Version bumped to 2.0.3.<br>\nSource in branch v2.0.3-wx3.2</p>\n<p>Once I have built in the default parking parameters for Windows and Linux, I propose to issue as production release for OCPN5.7.1+</p>",
