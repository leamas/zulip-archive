Not for cm charts and not for o-charts either.<br>\nIs this feature still available?  And if so, weI have to figure out why it is not working on my install.</p>\n<p>A second minor point: on 5.9. on Mac the chart hamburger is not working, zoom in/out, follow boat works, but not the hamburger. So, I cannot set the detail level of encs. This my be a bug, or a problem with my install.</p>",
