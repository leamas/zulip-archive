Right now I am setting up a local Dokuwiki server and downloading the Wiki so that hopefully we can create more a portable PDF and html manuals.</p>\n<p>As noted in <a href=\"https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:editor_manual:progress\">2024 Status and Progress</a> There are just a few places where some small improvements, clarifications and screenshots are missing.  I think it is just 4 places that I know of, these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:manual_basic:quick_start_guide:connect_to:global_navigation_satellite_system\">Connect to GNSS</a>    Need Raspberry Pi and MacOS Screenshots</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:manual_basic:set_options:charts:vector_charts\">Vector Display</a><strong>DONE</strong> Rick 5/27  Needs work See <a href=\"https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:manual_basic:set_options:charts:vector_charts#safety_depth_setting\">Safety Depth Setting</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:manual_basic:route_manager:use_routes\">Use Routes</a><strong>Needs Work</strong> Rick,5/27, Mermike 5/29 split route, 3 minor  Needs integration of new material from route properties.</p>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:manual_basic:route_manager:use_gpx_files\">Use GPX Files</a><strong>DONE?</strong> John  need Waypoint records.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If these could be fixed before I get the Dokuwiki Server running so we can actually complete the full PDF export (which times out on the OpenCPN server), then the Manual will be 100% complete as far as we know. If these can't be completed, that is probably not such a big issue.</p>\n<p>It appears that we have made the June 8 deadline set weeks ago (I had my doubts even then!) . Great job you guys. It wouldn't have happened but for all your efforts, I think we all learned new things about OpenCPN, I know I learned from each of you. I hope you will stay involved and continue to refine improve and update what has become the best User Manual yet!  I hope you hear my applause to this great group of skilled editors!</p>\n<p>Thanks, again. You have given the OpenCPN a wonderful gift.</p>\n<p>Rick</p>",
