Using versions saved by Inkscape after changing just the color looks quite different. I manage to eliminate the problem by changing width=“64” height=“64” to width=“18mm” height=“18mm”. It would be enough to just document that behaviour in my view. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even to me this is totally incomprehensible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does \"Similar issues\" refer to?</li>\n<li>In which file(s) are these changes done?</li>\n<li>What behaviour should be documented, is it perhaps already documented since this is the manual?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general it is IMHO a bad idea to just copy paste some random stuff from an issue to the manual like this.
