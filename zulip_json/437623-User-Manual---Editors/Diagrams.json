Because it seems to me that even the basic manual is giving so much information that t a lot of new users would get overwhelmed pretty quickly. </p>\n<p>So my question is: has it been agreed that all the information that is in the basic manual should stay in the manual and all that needs to be done is present that information in the best possible way? Or is it also possible to suggest that some of the information that is currently there maybe does not need to be in the basis manual?</p>\n<p>Or maybe a third option: Is it in idea to create a quick start guide, with really only the information you need to get Opencpn running with the basics?</p>",
