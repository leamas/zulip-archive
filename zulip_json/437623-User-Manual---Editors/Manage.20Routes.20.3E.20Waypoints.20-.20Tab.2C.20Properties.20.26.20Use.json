This  shall not be confused with points in a route, which are also called waypoints. They look similar, but behave differently, even though waypoints (aka marks) can be added to routes as well.  For instance, when deleting a route all waypoints of this route will be deleted, except those waypoints, who are actually marks.</p>\n<p>Manfred</p>",

Open the page, DWedit  then in Windows execute \"Find\"  Ctrl-F . In the lower right there will be a box. Type in there \"waypoint\"  (not waypoints)  Then look at the highlighted words.   You can get \"mark\" into your clipboard and highlight the \"waypoints\" and just paste Ctrl-V each one that needs to be changed.</p>\n<p>I think reading and doing this will each page so you get the context would be best.<br>\nI will do some tonight.
