The Chart Installation page can be daunting to new users and I found Fabio's page to be more useful for getting started. I think the Quick Start objective should be to get OpenCPN installed and working for some area of the world.</p>\n<p>The Chart Installation page is nice background after knowing that OpenCPN is working. I'm thinking that we need a Chart Installation page (or maybe two): one for free ENC charts and another for O-Charts. Then the existing \"Chart Installation\" page could be merged with Basic Manual &gt; Set Options &gt; Charts, which seems to cover a lot of the same information.</p>\n<p>Rick: Do you know if Fabio is still involved?</p>\n<p>Comments?</p>",

A few other countries have two rows, one for ENC and one for OSM Raster.  You've given options.</p>\n<p>Although I see the value of letting new users know there are options and giving them the choice, I see more value in a <strong>Quick</strong> Start manual of <strong>only</strong> giving one option that gets a <strong>new</strong> user started and further down putting a link to the complete list of options.  Or having the complete table further down the page.</p>\n<p>For USA I would leave only \"USA - NOAA &amp; Inland charts\" and \"ENC\".  For the other countries I'd leave ENC only.</p>\n<p>Another way of doing this without removing rows from the table would be to add a \"Suggested for New Users\" column, and marking only one of the rows, in my example \"USA - NOAA &amp; Inland charts\"/\"ENC\" for USA.</p>\n<p>My reasoning is that a <strong>new</strong> user might not know much about chart types, and might feel confused <span aria-label=\"confused\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f615\" role=\"img\" title=\"confused\">:confused:</span> .  I certainly did when I started with OpenCPN, I remember thinking \"what the hell are all these ENC, RNC, etc?\" <span aria-label=\"face with spiral eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f635-200d-1f4ab\" role=\"img\" title=\"face with spiral eyes\">:face_with_spiral_eyes:</span>  I had to Google before going back to the manual and continuing my chart install. </p>\n<p>Thoughts folks?</p>",
