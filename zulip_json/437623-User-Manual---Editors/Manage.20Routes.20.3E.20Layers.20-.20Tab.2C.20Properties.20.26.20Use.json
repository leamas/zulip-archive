Layers Tab and Use Layers under STAGING, mirroring what exists for the other elements of Routes. I could build a Layer Properties page that shows the difference in the properties for routes, tracks, and waypoints but that seems like overkill.<br>\nCould you take a look and comment? TODO: get newer screenshots to better match the text.<br>\nWhat do you think about renaming the Use Layers page in Advanced to something like \"Creating Layers\".</p>",
