However, releasing apps via the apple app store is not the only way of distributing an app.</p>\n<p>For users in the EU there is, for starters, the <a href=\"https://altstore.io\">Alt Store</a>.  Basically, you can install an app <em>Altstore PAL</em> which allows you to download apps from the Alt Store.  This can include 'self-published' apps.  Updating of apps is supported</p>\n<p>For users outside the EU, Alt Store provides an app for MacOS that allows side loading to an iOS/iPadOS device.  So you need a MacOS system to which you download the app and then load into the device.</p>",
