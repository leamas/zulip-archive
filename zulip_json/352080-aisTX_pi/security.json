So, in general, the source code must be published as well.<br>\nThat said, there is a mechanism to include a closed source blob in the plugin, as long as the interface to such blob does not involve direct object linkage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This does not look good. I need to look at some of my non-related stuff that built a standalone .exe.</p>",
