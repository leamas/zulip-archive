Neither for the plugin nor system performance?</p>\n<p>The \"virtual\" is for internal OCPN use. For example radar_pi use PushNMEABuffer() to send out ARPA objects by $RATTM which is used by OCPN, AIS_decoder,  to draw a ARPA target on screen. The same goes for a possible HDT received from a radar scanner. The \"source\" for both examples is not a physical connection but \"virtual\".</p>",
