        "content": "<p><strong>GSV satellites in view</strong><br>\nLet's see if I can make my thoughts understandable:<br>\nAs you know the counts of satellites in a GSV message can and would only be present in message number 1. That field in the other messages (#2-4) is empty, often parsed to \"nan\".</p>\n<p>So for a test I made the GSV CommDecoder::DecodeGSV to parse to \"temp_data.n_satellites\" only if message# = 1. I also tested to adapt the NMEA0183::GSV.cpp to only fill \"SatsInView\" if message#=1. That solved data transferred to Dashboard but still are the staples in the GNSS status icon on O upper right corner fluctuating.  Hmm...</p>\n<p>Then I realized the N2K PGN 129029 \"nSatellites\"  also feeding  \"temp_data.n_satellites\" shows the same fluctuation between '0' and e.g. '12'. That's a unsigned char so not so easy to make conditional but I tried and the result was the same. Fluctuating GNSS Icon. </p>\n<p>So I logged the values for \"temp_data.n_satellites\". Not nice! See below.<br>\nThis I don't fully understand but my assumption is when the value is not real, like 8, 10, 12... the \"temp_data.n_satellites\" shows a false memory value or some kind of pointer address instead??<br>\nFurther solution is above my head so you real developers may evaluate this. The goal is of course to have a stable GNSS icon in OCPN core and further on valid data to Dashboard as well. <br>\nThis problem is \"new\" and not shown in master branch. That's why I may suspect the \"temp_data.n_satellites\" definition to be involved?</p>\n<p>Log of \"temp_data.n_satellites\" from PGN 129029 . </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>11:46:04.392 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:05.392 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:06.391 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 12<br>\n11:46:07.391 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:08.393 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:09.393 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:10.392 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:11.393 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:12.391 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:13.392 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:14.391 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 12<br>\n11:46:15.393 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:16.392 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784<br>\n11:46:17.392 MESSAGE comm_bridge.cpp:362  <strong>*</strong> Satellites: 15988784</p>\n</blockquote>",
