This means that we no longer supports legacy plugins at all, we just refuse to load them. Fine with me if you ask, but it will at least require release notes or so, right?</p>",

For sure we cannot support them on Win or Mac, since we have no legacy plugins suitable for wx32.  And in the fullness of time, as they say, we will have wx32 on all platforms.  So let us make the break now..</p>",
