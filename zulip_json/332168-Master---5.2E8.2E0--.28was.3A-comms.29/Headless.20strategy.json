Many of these things is really about platform integration: devices which are attached while already started, how to initiate stop from outside, etc.</p>\n<p>There is also <a href=\"https://github.com/opencpn/OpenCPN/issues/3349\">#3349</a>. The solution for this is to use Dbus. I would say this is a no-brainer, using dbus instead of lock files resolves all otherwise tricky corner cases. Now, since this pulls in dbus anyway, we could of course use it also for other things.</p>\n<p>Now, dbus is linux only. OTOH, I don't really see a windows or macos headless device,  so such functionality might be linux only anyway as I see it.</p>\n<p>But that's just me. Thoughts?</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"573239\">@Pavel Kalian</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"517002\">@Dave Register</span></p>",
