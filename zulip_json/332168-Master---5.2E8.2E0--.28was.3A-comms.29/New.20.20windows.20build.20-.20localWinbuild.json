But it should never try to execute anything from that folder.  It should always execute from a folder based on the \"Configuration\" not on the \"Platform\".  I recall reading somewhere there is a way to build multiple platform types so maybe that is what your system is trying to do.

My windows skills being what they are,  I do embarrasing mistakes. Sorry for that.</p>\n<p>Background:  I'm doing this since I have a PR which works fine on the Linux side but crashes on Windows. Basically I need a stack trace from that crash. But it would also be the time when I finally got something more than the CLI usable on Windows.</p>\n<p>Hence, we have two different forks we need to merge. I have not done this properly earlier, my little brain produced the not so bright idea that using the <em>buildwin</em> directory from yor branch should be enough. Of course, it isn't and my earlier failures are thus not really usable. So, making a fresh start.</p>\n<p>I have rebased localBuildwin on my local branch tmp.  Doing so, I have ditched your changes to <em>src</em> and <em>include</em> since they collide with things I do. The resulting diff stat against localWInBuild below. This time I think I got it right, changes to sources should not be part of the drama here.</p>\n<p>I can now start the Debug build in VS, and generate the crash I want a trace from. However, VS still complains about missing debug info. The libraries are fine, but core OpenCPN seems to be generated without debug info.</p>\n<p>Rebuilding the Debug configuration does not help. Rebuilding after adding a hardcoded \"<code>set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)</code>to CMakeLists.txt does not help either.</p>\n<p>Some data points: The remote 'dan' is pointing to your repo.
