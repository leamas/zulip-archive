So a plugin will use the one that matches, depending on the API version it chooses to follow.<br>\nThere is one breakage to think about.  If an older plugin (pre-116) wishes to upgrade to say API-118 to take advantage of newer functions in later APIs, the author will need to adapt to the newer RenderOverlay(...) method signature, if indeed the plugin actually overrides this function in it implementation.
