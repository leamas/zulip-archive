Unit tests is all the rage in modern development, google it and you will be enlightened. </p>\n<p>One can use unit tests in two ways. The first is under development of new functions, like the the communications framework here. If you really adapt the test driven development paradigm you first make a test case and then implements the code which makes the test pass. Makes you do the right thing,  not spending time on other \"good to have\" stuff.</p>\n<p>The other way is about avoiding regressions. Once all is set, the unit tests are part of the build. This  catches regressions, and also makes it possible to make much more aggressive rewrites of  existing code.  This is the core reason why these tests are so good, if we just could get more coverage.</p>\n<p>Another aspect is that these kind of unit tests are reproducible, making it easier to communicate.</p>\n<p>If you have built any modern piece of sw you should have seen unit tests, usually as a \"test\" target, traditionally executed between \"build' and \"install\".</p>",
