To be useful one would need to merge this in small pieces. It's a bit hard, since everything depends on everything until done, but probably doable.</p>\n<p>Some bits and pieces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The route/waypoint database which now is in navutils is separated so it can be used without depending on the complete navutils mess.</li>\n<li>Track, Route, RoutePoint and  RouteMan have been splitted in to a gui part + core, thus making it possible to use the core elements without importing gui deps.</li>\n<li>Call from lower layers to dialogs have been handled using EventVar, std::function and, sparingly, evil #ifdefs.</li>\n<li>Various functions in navutil , OCPNPlatform have been  moved out of the guid deps part.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I do think these are important and good steps. Will try to create some  sane merge candidates later. For now, pushing the branch comm_deps which is the current status. It compiles and links cleanly, opencpn-cmd \"seems\" to work. The last test fails  due to test code problems, otherwise OK.</p>",
